<blockquote>
<p>The lectures really need no Foreword. They are
frankly propagandist, being delivered in the City of
Bombay, on the occasion of the return to that city
for the first time since the Anniversary held in Framji
Cowasji Hall, on December 7th, 1882, with 15 delegates
present. The little seed there planted in India
by our Founders has grown into a mighty tree. May
it continue to spread ever more widely its branches,
and may its leaves be for the healing of the Nations.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0"><span class="smcap">Friends</span>:</p>

<p>Amid the excitements of the present National
Week, amid all the Conferences on matters of importance
to the Nation, amid the discussions&mdash;industrial,
commercial, political&mdash;which are agitating
this great City, and will agitate it during the next
week, we, of the Theosophical Society, have ventured
to invite you here to consider not the passing
concerns of the moment but the perpetual concerns
of the life dealing with the eternal interests, the life
wherein alone permanence can ever be found.</p>

<p>I have chosen for the subject of our Convention
Lectures, those great problems of thought which ever
challenge the attention of the highest mind of man.
That question of questions of the nature, of our
conception, of God; the nature of man, his relation to
the Universe in which he finds himself&mdash;the evolution
of an intelligent spiritual Being amid the transitory
phenomena of passing worlds; then that profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
question of conduct, what is Right and what is Wrong?
is it possible to find a standard of ethics? is it possible
to find a canon of conduct which will guide us in
that tangled path of action which is one of the hardest
problems of human life? Then, lastly, the meaning
of Brotherhood, on what it is based, in what it consists,
what duties it imposes upon us, what is to be our
attitude to our brethren on every side. These
questions, that on these four mornings we are to
consider, are not questions of the passing time, but
are the problems that confront humanity at all the
stages of its evolution. Not only is that so, but in
this alone can we find peace, amid the turmoil of the
world; not in the constant struggles of outer life
may peace be found, but in the heart of peace which
abides in the <span class="smcap">Eternal</span>, that can remain peaceful in
the midst of storms, amid friends, amid enemies, amid
neutrals; only in the Peace of the <span class="smcap">Eternal</span> may the
human Spirit find abiding rest. When that centre
is found, when that knowledge of God which is
eternal life has been realised by man, then, and then
alone, can action be wisely taken, not swayed by
passion, not moved by prejudices, having nothing to
gain which the outer world can give and nothing to
lose which that world can take away; asking for nothing,
desiring nothing, save to be an instrument of the
Will that works for Righteousness, seeing in the world
around us the field of action where God is working,
and where we can be co-workers with God. There, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
there alone, can you work above the gu&#7751;as, using them
for the Divine purposes, but not permitting yourself
to fall under the glamour of their phenomena;
making use of all: of the passions of man, of the
aspirations of man, of the good and of the evil,
turning them all to send man forward on the path
which God has marked out for human progress.
That is the high activity which finds its expression
in Service, and that can only be where God has been
realised, and where the Spirit of man, consciously
one with the Spirit Eternal, sees everywhere one
Will, one Wisdom, and one Activity, and men, in all
their different workings, the instruments whereby
the Divine Will is worked out in evolution.</p>

<p>Hence, our study in these four morning hours is
not apart from the day's activity, but is really the
source, the spring, of that activity; and so, loving
all because in all the Self abides; seeing the inner
Self, unblinded by outer appearances; thus may work
the messengers of the great Hierarchy that guides
our world. It is to a treading of the path that
leads to Service, it is for that, that I invite your
attention to these profound problems of the spiritual
life of man.</p>

<p>Now, to-day, we are first to consider the nature,
the existence, of that One Life in which we all
subsist, and the views that man has taken thereof.</p>

<p>Let me say at the very outset, that there is a
common view to-day among many thoughtful, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
many good men, that it does not much matter what a
man believes providing that his conduct is right.
That is a half truth, not a whole truth, and it is the
natural reaction from the Middle Age view in Europe
that it did not matter what a man's conduct was
provided that his beliefs were orthodox. Such a
view has not only been found in medi&#230;val Europe,
but also has been found in India herself. You will
find among Indians to-day, as still among some
Christians, that the all-important matter is belief
in certain dogmas, and that where those are held
conduct is comparatively unimportant. We all know
men in all faiths who are orthodox, as it is said, in
belief, but whose lives are worldly lives, and sometimes
not even of a very high worldly character.
Now, a century or so ago that view was so common
that men were persecuted, men were penalised,
because of a difference of theological views. If
men did not believe, at one stage, the dogmas
of the Roman Catholic Church in Europe, then
their fate was, at first, the stake, then later the
prison, and still later, slander, social ostracism,
and disabilities under the law of the land. In
England, that is now largely swept aside, and we have
the opposite exaggeration: "Let a man think as he
will; but let him be a good citizen, a good man."
But that leaves out the profound truth that "man
is created by thought, and as a man thinks, so he is";
conduct is not independent of thought, for thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
is the spring of conduct, and so it is written in the
<i>Bhagava&#7693;-G&#299;&#7789;&#257;</i>, that "a man is compacted, composed,
of his beliefs," and as a man believes, so he is. You
have to make, however, a distinction between beliefs
conventionally accepted, and the real belief, which is
the conviction of the heart, out of which action
arises. And so, I urge on you to-day that right-thinking
on the great truths of life is a most important
part of the whole of your conduct. The better
your thought, the better will be your life. The truer
your thought, the more candid and transparent will
be your actions. But <i>remember that it must be your
own thought</i>, and not the thought of your neighbour,
not the thought of authority, not the thought of a book,
however ancient and however sacred, not the thought
of a great man, however true for him; the thought
that moulds conduct is the thought of the actor,
and every man is responsible for his own thinking; the
repetition of the thought of another is useless and even
mischievous. Be not then afraid to think, even about
God Himself. Do not think it is blasphemous to
enquire; do not think it is blasphemous to doubt.
Doubt is the stage which comes before a larger and
truer thinking. You doubt your past thought, because
you are opening up new vistas of thought and
the past is lying behind you. The man who never
doubts never really thinks; and there is a wholesome,
a healthy scepticism which is the forerunner of a
nobler and a truer faith. Think as far as you can. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
is true that from the very Highest thought and speech
fall back unable to go farther; but as far as you can
think, as far as your intellect is able to grasp, to
investigate, to argue, think your freest and your
noblest, and you will grow by your errors as well
as by your truths. Do not then fear to think;
do not fear to be called unorthodox; try your best to
think truly and accurately, and trust in Truth, who
never betrays her servant. The determination to
think your highest, the determination to think your
best, may lead you into some desert for a time, but
there are gardens on the other side of the desert.
You may have to cross many a desert, many a torrent
which seems to sweep you away; but I, who ventured
all to seek for Truth, who left family, friends, religion,
because their religion had become to me untrue, I bear
you witness that such unbelief is the way to a higher,
a greater, and a serener faith, and that those who
are unwilling to lose the life of the past will not be
able to advance into the life of the future.</p>

<p>Now, let us, with regard to our thoughts of God,
realise that there are two lines towards knowledge.
The first is the way of the intellect, which deals
with metaphysics, which deals with philosophy,
which gradually lifts a man out of superstition,
out of narrowness, out of ignorance, and carries him
as far as human intellect can go. Along those
lines exercise your intellect, think your best, but
remember, that it is written that not by intellect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
shall the Self be found, and the path of realisation
is not the path of the intellect. It is the path of
the conquered senses, of the conquered mind, when
in the "quietude of the senses and the tranquillity
of the mind, the man beholds the glory of the Self".
That is realisation: that is the only knowledge:
that is Eternal Life. By the intellect we reach the
highest philosophy, and let none dare to despise
philosophy, which rises up to peaks of knowledge,
which are the glory of the human race. But, on
the other hand, remember that it is the pure in
heart who see God. It is the conquest of the lower
nature which enables us to breathe the air in
which the higher nature lives; and not by intellectual
research, not even by devotion itself, but by sinking
into the depths of your own being, by searching
within, there where the Self abides; by casting aside
everything that changes; by saying to the senses:
"You are not I"; by saying to the mind: "You are
not I"; by saying to the highest intelligence: "You
are not I"; in the silence, where the mind has
naught to say; in the silence, where the senses are
not heard; in the depths of yourself, one with the
Supreme Self; there, and there only, shall you realise
that you yourself are one with the Self Universal. A
hard path, a difficult path, the outcome of the
practice of lives of self-abnegation and of service;
but once you have realised God, you can never doubt
again. An intellectual argument may be overthrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
by keener logic, by larger grasp of facts; but the
man who once has seen the Face of God, he never
again can doubt that God is, that God is All. That
is the Self-realisation of the Mystic. That is the
triumph, not of the intellect but of the Spirit; then the
Spirit which is Divine recognises its kinship with the
Spirit Omnipresent, and when once, as I have said
before, you have found God within yourself, then, and
only then, will you find Him in every one in everything,
around you. That is the triumph of the
Spirit. That is the Peace of the <span class="smcap">Eternal</span>.</p>

<p>And now, let us turn to man's conceptions of God,
and see how they have changed. And, in doing this,
friends, let us seek for the kernel of truth which
underlies even mistaken beliefs; for, man is so
constituted that no error can hold him long in
bondage save by the truth that that error conceals.
Just as you may have the husk, the shell, and the
kernel within it, so in every error that dominates
mankind there is a kernel of truth that gives it its
nutritive power. Only when you recognise the kernel
of truth will you be able to convince a man of the
husk of error.</p>

<p>Now, looking back to early times in our race, we
find what is called Polytheism; and that you
practically find everywhere. You find it very very
strongly in the first half of the Hebrew <i>Old Testament</i>,
as is called the Hebrew part of the Christian
Bible. If you read that, what is the God that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
find? Clearly, a God of limited power, a God of
limited knowledge, what in the talk, the jargon,
of the day is called a "tribal God". In the
early story told by the Hebrews, the conception
of God is very limited. You find Him "walking
in the garden in the cool of the day," and calling
out to the man he had created: "Adam, where art
thou?" You find him a little later&mdash;when men have
multiplied and begun to build a tower which in
their ignorance they think will reach up to heaven&mdash;saying;
"Go to, let us go down, and there confound
their language, that they may not understand one
another's speech." For "now nothing," he said,
"will be restrained from them, which they have
imagined to do". And so, we read, that "the Lord
came down to see the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded," and he confused the speech
of the builders, so that they were scattered abroad
and could not build their tower. And the Babel of
Tongues is a phrase in English, because it was the
Tower of Babel from which all the languages on
earth originated! You find him again with his
chosen people, the children of Abraham, leading them
into the land he gives them; and then you come
across the remarkable statement that "the Lord was
with Judah," one of the tribes, and he drove out all
"the inhabitants of the mountain, but could not
drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they
had chariots of iron". You see at once that you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
in the realm of a very limited kind of tribal God. Of
course, I know that in the days when the Bible was
regarded as verbally inspired, as God's Word, they
said these statements were an accommodation to the
ignorance of man; but that is only the desperate
effort of the believer in verbal inspiration to infuse
the knowledge of later days into the form of ancient
fables. You and I recognise at once that where
thoughtful Christians are concerned, these are to
them old ideas, that you have here the local God, the
tribal God, and that the God of the Hebrews of the
early days does not claim to be the only God, but
only the chief one, the chief for his own nation:
"Who among the Gods is like unto Thee, O Jehovah!"
That is the position of the Hebrews, and they have
their own National God. To go away from him is
treachery to the State. To disbelieve in him is
punishable with death, because it is treason to the
Nation, and such punishment was not so much regarded
as a religious persecution as a State penalty. As
a State and social sanction, the worship of Yahveh
was maintained among the Hebrews; it was the State,
the National, Religion. He conquered the Gods of
the Philistines, He fought with the Gods of all the
other people round about, each with their own God.</p>

<p>Then you come to a new aspect. The people of
Israel are scattered; they are carried away captives into
Babylon. They come into touch with the great Theologies
of the East, and then a new view of God is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
by their writers. You may draw a line in the Hebrew
Old Testament between the post-Babylon, and the
pre-Babylon views of God. That is done now by every
scholar. The pre-Babylon view is that of the Tribal God,
one among many; the post-Babylon view is the sublime
conception drawn from a great eastern faith, and
then we find poetic and splendid phrases regarding
God. He is the "High and Lofty One who inhabiteth
Eternity, whose Name is Holy". There you have
a spiritual thought. You are no longer within the
region of the tribal Gods. You are out of the region
of the local Deities; you have passed on into a
great and spiritual world, where God inhabits
Eternity, and where, in another splendid phrase, it
is written: "God made man in the image of His own
Eternity." There you have the later conception,
there the God Universal; and with that, one remarkable
fact that you must never forget, that in
the later writing God is recognised not as what we
call the Author of good only, but the Author of evil
also. It is written in the Prophet Isaiah: "I am the
Lord, and there is none else; I form the light and
create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I
the Lord do all these things." It is written again:
"Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath
not done it?" You must realise that where God is
seen as "the One," when there is "none else," then
He is the Author of all, and not only of the particular
line of narrow morality that belongs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
evolving human kind. So also in the <i>Bhagava&#7693;-G&#299;&#7789;&#257;</i>
you find the phrase of Shr&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;h&#7751;a: "I am the
gambling of the cheat." I shall come back to that
in order to point out to you its meaning, but at the
moment I only ask you to remember that in what is
now called the Christian Bible, not in the Hebrew
part of it only, but in the Christian part as well, you
find that same conception of one "Light that lighteth
every man that cometh into the world," that shows
itself in every form, that cannot be divorced from anything
that exists. And so, in a very splendid psalm,
again post-Babylon, you have the psalmist saying:
"If I go up into Heaven, Thou art there; if I
make my bed in Hell, behold, Thou art there also;
if I take the wings of the morning and dwell
in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there
shall Thy Hand guide me, and Thy Right
Hand lead me." Heaven or Hell, what are they?
passing phenomena of human evolution. If God is
found in Heaven, he is also found in Hell; only in
Heaven he is the Bliss of Unity with the Law; in Hell
He is the Pain of Law disregarded, and that, in order
that by the suffering caused by the onward rush of
the disregarded Law, He may teach the lesson of
obedience to the Law, the lesson which the man
refused to learn by precept, and must therefore, for
his own future safety, learn by experience. Now that
idea is eastern. When the Christians wrote the New
Testament, they narrowed this profound idea of God.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>They brought also, those post-Babylon Jews, they
brought also the Babylonian conception of an Evil Spirit
over against the Good, the great idea in Zoroastrianism
of the opposition between Hormazd and Ahriman, that
coloured all the Christian concepts. The Satan of
Christianity, the Satan of the Christians, is the Ahriman
of the Zoroastrians. And so also with the Eblis
of the Musulm&#257;ns. He is the enemy of God. There
you come down, as it were, to the planes of practice.
Two forces quarrel for the mastery and we call them
good and evil, recognising the duality of the flesh and
the Spirit. We take that duality, and we put one over
against the other. We forget that the flesh is necessary
for the unfolding of the Spirit. We forget that matter
is the necessary field in which the Seed of Divinity
shall develop into the manifest God, and so we lose
the Unity. We live in the realm of duality, and we
make opposites, as they are in practical life, of those
two sides of Deity, the Spirit that informs, the matter
that makes action possible. Zarathushtra has, behind
his duality, that "Boundless Space" which is really
the description of the all-enveloping nature of God
Universal; and when we deal with Hin&#7693;&#363;ism, we
find there the explanation of those rather fragmentary
truths that come down to us along other lines. We
have finally that terrible blunder of the Christian, who
makes God, all love&mdash;as in truth He is&mdash;giving forth
from Himself&mdash;for He is the only creator, One,
"there is none else"&mdash;the Spirit Satan, who is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
embodiment of hatred; and you find, finally, that in
the great struggle, according to the common Christian
belief&mdash;which intellectual Christians are outgrowing,
you must not forget&mdash;you find in the final result of
the struggle, that it is not God, but Satan that is the
conqueror, for "the bottomless pit" is full to overflowing,
while Heaven is a city with walls around it,
and with a comparatively limited number of
inhabitants. But that is not the deeper teaching of
Christianity; it is the crude popular view. If you go
through the writings of S. Paul, what is written
there? You find it is written that the day shall
come when the Son, who is God, shall be "subject
to Him who put all things under Him, and
God shall be all in all"&mdash;God in Satan, God in Hell,
God in the wicked, evolving them to righteousness.
And so in the very centre of the Christian teaching
you find that "God is all and in all," and is it not
also written in <i>Al Qur&#257;n</i>, which largely reflects the
popular necessary teachings of the time, is it not
written by the great Prophet of Arabia, that "All
shall perish, save His Face"? Everywhere is God;
God is everything; in everything He is the ultimate
good, the inevitable fate of man.</p>

<p>But now what does this Polytheism mean? There is
a truth in it. For every Nation has its own &#7692;eva, as
we should say; its own Angel, as the Christian and
Musalm&#257;n would say. These subordinate hosts, these
Angels and Archangels, these &#7692;evas and &#7692;ev&#299;s, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
are all superhuman intelligences, working out the will
of God the Supreme. Think for a moment of Astronomy.
There was a time when this little world was the
centre of the Solar System, when fixed, with the
Waters below and the Waters above, the Sun, the
Moon, the Stars also, circled around our Globe.
Science gradually found out that the universe was
larger than the Solar System; that the Universe had
many Suns and many systems. It found out that
our globe went round the Sun and not the Sun round
our globe. The world was lifted out of this position
of superiority and thrown out into space, one among
myriads of worlds; that was the heresy for which
Giordano Bruno died. He proclaimed the multiplicity
of worlds, and that the Sun was the centre of our
system, but that there were other worlds and other
Suns. In the old days that was a frightful horror,
for he turned everything upside down. What can
you do with Christian teachings if our globe is one
among many? Christ died for this world. Did God
die for a grain of dust in an endless Universe?
The whole dignity of our world was lost. Then they
said that Christ ascended up into Heaven, but Bruno
said that there was no "up" and no "down". Our
world with space below it; our world with space above
it. Where then is Heaven? Where is Hell? Where
is Heaven? Where is the Throne of God? Where
the right hand of God where Christ is sitting?
Where did He go to on that Ascension day? Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
is He to be found in this unlimited space? And so
they said: "Oh! burn him, get rid of him, send
him to find the worlds of which he talks." So they
burnt him and scattered his ashes, and joyed that he
was dead. But Bruno lived still although the body
was dead, and Science, Science triumphed, although
its votaries were burnt, were racked, were imprisoned.
They took Galileo and forced him to his knees to
confess that he had been mistaken; "and yet it
moves," were the whispered words of the Scientist,
who did not dare to face the horrors of the
Inquisition. And so Science triumphed, and now,
what do you find? Not only that our Sun is, to us, a
stationary body and the world goes round it; but that
ours is only one of many systems, and that all those
systems and their Suns go round another Sun, and that
is not the last, and again that is not the last; for all
those masses of systems, they also go round a still
higher Sun, and so concentric circles of worlds, of
systems, of Universes, without end that human eye
can pierce, without end that human mind can grasp;
and so we begin to realise that the local Gods of the
past, they have their places, all circling round the One
who is the centre of all life, "the One without a
Second". All Universes rise and fall in Him. All Universes
are born and die in His immensity. No thought
may limit Him. No mind may grasp Him. He is
the All, the One, the Omnipresent, and His Life
lives in the Angels and Archangels, lives in the &#7692;evas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
of all the systems, and in all they are His Ministers,
carrying out His Will.</p>

<p>And so there arose what is called Pantheism. God
is All and in all. Now there is a great difference
between the Pantheism of the West as embodied in
Spinoza, and the Pantheism of the East, that you
find in the Ve&#7693;as, that you find in the Zend-Avesta,
that you find in the old dead Religions of Egypt, of
Greece, of Rome. The Pantheism of the West is one
Divine Existence with certain attributes, the Spinozean
Pantheism. It is the Formless Boundless
Existence. Not quite the Nirgu&#7751;a Brahman, the
"Brahman without attributes". His Pantheism
is as cold and uninspiring for conduct, as
the Nirgu&#7751;a Brahman would be if that were the
last word of Hin&#7693;&#363;ism. Infinite, All-embracing,
All-in-holding, out of Space and Time, that is
the central thought of every great philosophy,
Musalm&#257;n, Hin&#7693;&#363;, Zoroastrian, I might almost say
Christian&mdash;though that is more doubtful, for it is
more rigid, and narrowed by being confined more or
less within the conceptions of the Bible. If you go
to the great Musalm&#257;n Doctors of the ninth and
tenth centuries <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> you will find magnificent
descriptions of the All-God. In That is said to
exist not only what has been, not only what is,
but that which shall he, and all eternally existent,
all that is conceivable, all that is inconceivable,
all is in Him. It is the same as the A&#7693;vai&#7789;a-Ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>&mdash;if
you take away from that the conception of
the Sagu&#7751;a Brahman, and the devotional side of
Shr&#299; Sha&#7749;kar&#257;ch&#257;rya in his s&#7789;o&#7789;ras&mdash;the One without
a Second, embracing all, conceiving all, all-existing,
one Now, without past, present, and future, nothing to
be excluded. But then comes the next step, the
Sagu&#7751;a Brahman, the "Brahman with attributes,"
that is not a second, but the One in manifestation.
He manifests a part of Himself. Said Shr&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;h&#7751;a:
"I established this Universe with a portion of myself,
and I remain"; all-transcending, all-embracing, the
manifested God, limiting Himself by manifestation.
And so Manu speaks of Him as "a mountain of
light," the generating Light; the One with attributes,
but the attributes belong to the manifestation.
They might vary perchance in another age, in
another Universe. Then there go forth from Him the
three great manifestations, Will, or Power; Wisdom,
or Self-Realisation; Activity, or Creative Intelligence,
and that threefold manifestation, of Power, of Self-Realisation,
of Creative Intelligence, that is the root
of every Trinity, as it is called, that you find in the ancient
and in the modern worlds. Three forms of
Manifestation inherent in one Existence, the creative
Power, that brings a Universe into existence, called
Brahm&#257; among Hin&#7693;&#363;s; the sustaining all-preserving
Power, that maintains a Universe, all-permeating,
all-preserving, that is called Vi&#7779;h&#7751;u; and He into
whom all re-enters, the Destroyer, the Regenerator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
He into whom all returns that a higher form may reappear,
that is Mah&#257;&#7693;eva, Shiva, the Supreme Bliss.</p>

<p>Naturally among a people unmetaphysical and unphilosophical,
you get a division which in truth does
not exist. They see three different Deities and quarrel
over them, where there is only One, showing Himself
in the three essential forms for a Universe which
comes, which lives, which passes; and hence you have
the Shaiva and the Vai&#7779;h&#7751;ava fighting the one against
the other. I saw the other day in the caves of Elephanta,
the Ar&#7693;ha Shiva Ar&#7693;ha Vi&#7779;h&#7751;u, the Hari-Hara, which
is said in the legends to be the combination of the twain
in one. A fanatic was worshipping one and depreciating
the other, it is said, and the image of Vi&#7779;h&#7751;u
changed, and became half Mah&#257;&#7693;eva and half Vi&#7779;h&#7751;u,
and the double image smiled upon the worshipper, to
remind him that the division was in man and not in
God.</p>

<p>So also there are hosts of &#7692;evas, for the eastern
Pantheism includes the innumerable forms in which
God-in-all expresses Himself, and so we have Polytheism
in a higher form. You need not be afraid of words,
for that is the all-embracing truth. Polytheism asserts
the existence of the &#7692;evas and &#7692;ev&#299;s, who carry out
the Will of the Supreme. "Not for the sake of the
&#7692;eva is the &#7692;eva dear, but for the sake of the Self
is the &#7692;eva dear." Only as the manifestation of
the Self is the &#7692;eva seen, as you, in your turn,
are manifestations of the same Self. But the &#7692;eva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
is a more highly evolved manifestation than you
are. These innumerable ministers of the Supreme
Will, they also are manifestations of the One; they mar
not the Unity. And so in the Ve&#7693;as you chant to
all of them; and so in the Zend-Avesta you invoke
them all.</p>

<p>Now the Western will tell you that all these &#7692;evas
of yours are the personifications of the elements; that
Agni is not a being, but is the Fire personified. You
must turn that right upside down, if you want to
make it true. Agni is not a personification of the
element Fire; but Fire, the element, is the material
expression of Agni, his body, his vehicle, by which he
shows himself in the world. And that is your key.
Ignorance personifies an Element. Knowledge sees
a Being whose material expression is an Element.
Ignorance sees the physical. Knowledge sees in
everything physical a manifestation of the One Self,
showing Himself in a limited form for the helping of
His world. And so the higher Occultist may address
Agni, the &#7692;evar&#257;ja of Fire, and, below Agni, countless
hosts of those who are called Fire &#7692;evas, or Fire
Elementals, all expressions of his nature, all using a
special type of matter in the world. Hence you hear
that when the world was built, the elements came
forth, and each had the Life-principle within it. Fire
came forth, but Agni, the &#7692;evar&#257;ja, was the Life-principle
within the fire-matter, and so with Varu&#7751;a
for water, and so with Kubera for earth. You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
within every Element, nay, within everything that you
call a law in nature, you have a Life-principle, a &#7692;eva,
or Angel, call him what you will, names matter not,
provided that you realise that the Self which works
in you as man, works in all these Beings in ascending
ranks of hierarchical power; but they all are expressions
of the one Divine Will, and the One works in
all of them, and "the wise see the One, although they
call Him by many names".</p>

<p>Now there you have the whole truth: God is everything
and in All. God is manifested in countless
forms, in countless grades of living intelligences, and
each has its own place, and the &#7692;evas come forth
from Brahm&#257;, as later from Him come forth vegetables
and animals and men. There is only the One
Life, but it is manifest in infinite forms&mdash;Pantheism-cum-Polytheism,
God-in-a-Universe. Now, if you
realise that, if you understand that, all these many
&#7692;evas and &#7692;ev&#299;s, these many Angels and Archangels,
are only expressions, phenomena, manifestations, of the
One, just as you are. Then, you will realise that all
these, carrying out the Divine Will, are the hearers
of prayer, are the guardians of mankind; some are
guardians of Nations, others the guardians of special
areas smaller than Nations, but all are agents of the
One. When the peasant prays to the form that he worships,
and asks for help, that is really a prayer to the
One Supreme, which is answered by His minister, the
&#7692;eva who is addressed by the peasant; and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
talk to the peasant here in India, you will find that
most, if not all, of them realise the One behind the
many, and know, that the One alone is God, although
they appeal to those who are nearer in evolution to
themselves, as they ask a Collector rather than the
King. And so we begin to realise that Polytheism
has its truth, and only needs to be understood. Then
all Nature becomes living, beautiful, sympathetic, God
smiles in everything. The thinker should realise it,
and then none will ever blur the Unity by the multiplicity
of manifestations. Thus you come to the
whole truth, and find it living, exquisite, a perpetual
joy. All Nature lives and loves. There is but One
Life, but One Existence, but one Supreme Omnipresent
Being. We cannot call him Spirit, because Spirit is the
antithesis of Matter, and Spirit and Matter blend in
Him. So we call Him the <span class="smcap">One without a Second</span>.
In the boundless realms of space, in the infinity of
Universes, that <span class="smcap">One</span> is expressing Himself in countless
ways, but all is a manifestation of Himself. He the
One Thinker; from Him, all thought comes forth. He,
the one Actor; from Him all activities proceed. All
our human words of right and wrong, of good and
evil, those are limited to the evolving lives in relation
to each other. There is nothing that can be excluded
from the One and Universal. In Him, all is well, all is
highest and best. And, when we come to deal with
Right and Wrong, we shall see how this works out,
how it gives us a human standard, a standard by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23&ndash;24</a></span>
we may guide our steps. But, for this morning, I
will leave with you that Supreme Ideal: that there
is but the One in All, in Everything; the lowest
dust beneath your feet has the One within it; the
highest &#7692;eva in the highest heaven is but another
expression of the One. You express Him, the
animal expresses Him, the vegetable expresses Him,
the mineral expresses Him. How else shall they live,
save in Him who is life? How else shall they evolve,
save in Him who is manifesting Himself through
them? Be not afraid to love the world, which is
one of His manifestations, one of His thoughts; but
see Him everywhere and in everything, and so shall
everything become spiritualised. Let Him speak to
you through the world, as He speaks to you through
the Spirit. He speaks in every breath of air; He
speaks in every leaf on the forest tree; He speaks in
the foam and crash of the Ocean's breaking billows;
He speaks in the solitude and silence of the Mountain.
There is none other. There is nothing else. He is
the One Existence. And as you realise that, you
share His power, and you share His peace.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="sigleft in0"><span class="smcap">Friends</span>:</p>

<p>I will ask you to remember the point at which we
had arrived when the first lecture was concluded. We
had studied the nature, the existence of God, and we
had come to the point where we realised one all-pervading
Life, the One without a Second, the One
Life permeating every form from the lowest mineral
to the highest &#7692;eva, nay&mdash;the Lord of the Universe,
&#298;shvara Himself. He also is an embodiment of the
Supreme Self, showing forth infinite Power, Wisdom
and Activity, the attributes of the Self, showing them
forth in supreme measure. But even in &#298;shvara Himself,
the Lord of the Universe, we recognise that He is an
embodiment, and that, as is written in the <i>Bh&#257;gava&#7789;a</i>,
there are many &#298;shvaras, many Shivas, Vi&#7779;h&#7751;us,
Brahm&#257;s, each triplet the centre of a Universe, each
the &#298;shvara of a Kosmos. Realising that, then, as our
foundation, and that everything in a Universe, in
its measure, is animated by the One Life, inspired
by the One Energy, moved by the One Will, we
then descend from those great heights to study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
one phase of the embodiments, that which we know
as <span class="smcap">Man</span>. Realise that Man is only one grade in this
mighty hierarchy of existences, that, beginning with
the mineral, passing onwards through the vegetable,
then ascending through the animal, culminates in
Man, more and more of the Supreme Life shown
out stage by stage. You may remember how the
great commentator S&#257;ya&#7751;a pointed out that the
Supreme Self in the mineral shows out only the
quality of existence. Passing onwards to vegetable
and animal, He shows out there the attribute
of consciousness. Passing onwards to Man, He
reveals Himself in fuller measure&mdash;Man, who remembers
what is past, who forecasts that which
is yet to come. While man heads these ascending
grades in our normal world, we yet pass
onward in thought to the great hierarchies of
Super-Men, of &#7692;evas&mdash;Angels, call them what you
will&mdash;then still onwards and onwards, ever in
ascending grades of Power, of Wisdom and of Activity,
until we reach those mighty Spirits who stand, as it
were, around &#298;shvara Himself, His Viceroys in the
mighty Empire of our system, all subordinates and
ministers, who carry out the will of the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>Now in this great Ladder of Life, Man occupies
what we may call a middle place. The characteristic
of Man is that in him there is a warfare of
Spirit and of Matter, striving for the mastery. In the
mineral, in the vegetable, in the animal, there you find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Matter is supreme; Spirit is most deeply veiled in the
mineral, rather less veiled in the vegetable, still less
in the animal. When we come to Man, in his lowest
condition we find that Matter is still triumphant;
then a struggle begins, and at last Spirit
shows himself triumphant. Matter is spiritualised
by the indwelling Life, and instead of being a fetter
and a clog it becomes a vehicle, an expression of the
indwelling, the directing, Spirit. The interest then of
Man is that in all the stages of his long evolution the
struggle is going on. First we see Matter is supreme.
Gradually as Mind develops, the lowest manifestation
of the Spirit, the struggle becomes marked; then
slowly and gradually evolving, ever further and
further, in the Saints, in the Sages of our race, we
find the triumph of the human over the animal, the
triumph of the Spirit over Matter; it is that mighty
evolution that is the subject of our study this morning.</p>

<div class="tb">
    * <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span>
</div>

<p>Where shall we begin? We must necessarily begin
in the bosom of &#298;shvara Himself, whence come forth
the human Spirits, the J&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257;s. For is it not
written that as millions of sparks go forth from
the flaming fire, so do the J&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257;s go forth
from &#298;shvara Himself; or again, do we not find it
said by Shr&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;h&#7751;a, speaking as the Supreme
&#298;shvara: "A portion of Myself&mdash;Mam&#257;msha&mdash;a
fragment of Myself, going forth into the world of
Matter, draws round itself the senses, and mind
as the sixth." There you have the definition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Man. A portion of &#298;shvara Himself, a fragment
of that illimitable Life, thrown down into the world
of Matter, which incases the fragment within
itself, which that fragment is destined to turn into
a vehicle for the unfolded powers of God. As a seed
is cast into the ground and within that seed lie
hidden every power, every beauty, every possibility
of the tree that sent it forth, so from the eternal
Tree of Life of God Himself the seed is cast into
the soil of our world, impotent, helpless, nescient&mdash;knowing
nothing at first. But, inasmuch as it is a
seed of God, it is destined to unfold Divine Powers, and
to become in the course of ages the image of That
from whom it has come forth. And so we find it
written in the <i>B&#7771;ha&#7789; &#256;ra&#7751;yaka</i>, showing the contrast
between the Supreme &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, the Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, and the
Jiv&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, the human Spirit: "All-powerful the one,
but powerless the other." In the one, all power
manifests; in the other, every potentiality is present.
And so, you find also in the later religion of Christianity,
that it is declared by the mouth of the Christ
Himself: "Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father
which in Heaven is perfect." I ask all of you to
realise what lies in those words of the Christ; as God
in Heaven is perfect, such is the destiny of the
children of men; not always to be weak and frivolous,
not always to be childish and impotent, but to become,
in the course of ages, <i>perfect</i> as God Himself is
perfect. That, and nothing less than that, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
destiny of every one of you. You may delay it; you
may retard it; you may wander in many bye-ways
and lose ages of time; but what is time, however long,
to you who are eternal, for whom there is no limit of
space or time, inasmuch as your essence is the essence
of God Himself. Nothing less than that, your
Future.</p>

<p>But now, let us look at this Seed of Divinity and
ask: How it is to develop, how it is to grow into
splendour so illimitable? For though you be sons of
a King, though your heritage be sure in the future,
you may yet, if you will, grovel in the mire; you may,
if you will, forget your birthright; you may think
yourselves children of the dust, while you are children
of &#298;shvara; but you must at last come to your
inheritance, for the Divine Will in you cannot be
ultimately frustrated, and your destiny, your Divine
destiny, must be worked out.</p>

<p>Now, we have a fragment of Divinity embodied in
flesh. Under what conditions, by what laws, is that
fragment to evolve, to unfold its powers? There are
two great laws under which that Seed of Divinity
must develop into manifested God. The one, the
Law of Reincarnation; the turning of the wheel of
births and deaths to which every one of us is bound;
where freedom can only come to us by realising our
Divinity; whence we may not escape until the law is
utterly fulfilled. And the second, the Law of Karma,
that law of the Divine Nature in which everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
exists related, bound together, by simultaneous
co-existence; hence, when out of that Eternity any
portion of the Divine comes into space and into time,
you have causation, where before there was simultaneity.
You have what you call causation, which is
only the coming into appearance and recognition of
the real simultaneity of all. In God all is; in man
all becomes; but that is the only difference; and what
you call causation is nothing more than the unfolding
in time, which is succession, of that which ever exists
out of time in the Supreme. Let us then see how the
law works, and it works through many stages, it
works through endless ages. We have our Divine
Seed&mdash;a child-Spirit, let us call him&mdash;born into our
world. He is not left there alone, to find out by long
experience only how evolution must proceed; for, out
of previous Universes, out of past evolutions in other
worlds, there come to the helping of these infant
children of Man, Those who have passed through the
earlier stages, and have become superhuman in Their
knowledge and Their power. There are two ways of
finding out the existence of a law. One, the way in
which, surrounded by the laws of nature that we may
not change nor violate, unknowing that they exist,
unconscious that they are around us, we are like a
man in a darkened chamber, where there is no light
to see his environment, who knocks himself up
against one thing or another and bruises himself in
the knocking. By the bruising, he finds out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
obstacles; by the pain that he suffers, he finds that
he can only move without pain in a certain direction.
That is the scientific way. Every law of nature that has
been so far discovered by Science has been discovered
by experience which has turned ignorance into knowledge.
Take Roger Bacon, one of the early chemists
in the days when to investigate was heresy, in the
days when to understand was crime. He was a monk,
but a monk with the soul of a scientist in him. He
experimented with chemical substances. He knew
nothing about them. He did not know that putting
these two together made a new and useful substance;
that putting another two together made an explosive
substance, that scattered everything around. He put
together whatever he could find. What was the
result? One time he was stretched senseless on the
floor of his cell; another time a finger was blown off;
another time an eye was blown out; onward and onward
he went, with that dauntless courage, that interminable
patience, which make the truly scientific
man, who looks on knowledge as the supreme good.
Struck senseless he came to again, and began again
his work: missing a finger, he used the rest for new
experimentation: when one eye had gone, the other
remained with which he could still see. And, by
such pain, by such loss, such infinity of dangers,
Science slowly won its way to its knowledge of the
laws around it. Inviolably, unchangeably, God manifests
in Nature.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>The result of the long experimenting is that now,
when the young man goes into the laboratory, textbooks
are ready for him. A professor is there to warn
him where the dangers of investigation lie. "Do
not put," he will say to him, "nitrogen and chlorine
together; if you put them together without certain
precautions, you will find yourself in fragments and
your laboratory will be destroyed." The boy in the
laboratory now does not experience the dangers of
earlier investigators. That, for him, is done. Men
have come to show him the way, and the experience
of the Past is the guide to the knowledge of the
Present, and the warning to the dangers of the
Future. So with Man. There were Professors, there
were Teachers, round the infant races of our Globe.
We call them &#7770;&#7779;his; we call them Saints; we call them
God-illuminated men; we call them Sages; Founders
of Religions; and They said to infant humanity, as the
Professor says to the boy in the laboratory: "Do that,
don't do the other. Here lies safety; there lies danger.
Take our experience as a guide, and you will realise
the existence of the law; your happiness lies in your
obedience, in your conformity with law." Hence,
infant humanity started with the advantages of Sages
to guide it who proclaimed the law.</p>

<p>Now, for a moment, put yourselves by imagination
in the position of one of those infant races, hearing
the words of the Teacher, and willing to learn. "If,"
said the Teacher, "you follow that course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
conduct, misery will result." You may remember
the words of the Lord Bu&#7693;&#7693;ha, that "as the wheels
of a cart follow on the heels of the ox, so misery
follows on the commission of evil. As the wheels of the
cart follow the heels of the ox, so happiness follows
on the commission of right." And why? because, as
we shall see to-morrow, right is harmony with law, and
wrong is discord with it. And, as the law cannot be
broken, as the law itself is inviolable, the man who
dashes himself against it is like the ship that dashes
against a rock; the rock remains unmoving, but
the ship is shattered into pieces. So is it with the
law, the expression of the Divine Nature.</p>

<p>Now the recognition of law was helped by those
declarations of the Teachers. For when a man, disobedient
and careless, committed a wrong act, he
suffered; and then he said: "I was told that I
should suffer; after all, the Teacher was right; I
have made myself miserable by disobeying the law."
And the earlier lessons of man ran along these
lines.</p>

<p>Let us see how it worked out. A savage. His
passions are his guides. He knows none other.
He wants and takes; he desires and grasps; but he
is living among others who also want and take, who
also desire and grasp, and, there is a conflict between
the desires of one man and another. We will follow
one man: He sees his neighbour's wife; desires her;
he takes her; perhaps, kills the husband&mdash;he is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
a savage, remember. He sees in his neighbour's tent
food that he wants; he strikes the man down, and
takes away the food. And he thinks: "I have done
well; I am happy; I have gained a beautiful woman;
I have gained food; I am no longer hungry. This is
the path of happiness for me." But he has made
enemies. The friends of those whom he may have
struck down in his licentiousness, they are his enemies,
and presently he has to die, perhaps is killed in
revenge. But, what we call Death is only the striking
away of the body in which the Spirit eternal is
dwelling, and this ignorant creature, when the body
is struck away, finds himself in the midst of people
whom he robbed and murdered during his life on
earth. He is surrounded by enemies; he finds on the
other side antagonism and hatred; and he learns in
the other world&mdash;the world we call Pre&#7789;aloka or
K&#257;maloka&mdash;he learns there that to do these things
means sorrow, and that pain is the ultimate result of
the desire unjustly satisfied. It makes a little
impression upon him. But during his life, he has
not only robbed and murdered: he has loved; perhaps
he has loved the woman he stole; perhaps he
has loved the child that was born of her. Those little
seeds of love remain. The Spirit carries them with
him as he passes out of the body, and when he
has suffered in Pre&#7789;aloka the result of the evil he has
done, he passes on to Pi&#7789;&#7771;loka and to Svarga, to enjoy
the good that he has accomplished; and the seed of love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
selfish probably, desiring gratification, finds in Pi&#7789;&#7771;loka
satisfaction, and the power to love increases.
And where there has been a seed of unselfish love,
perhaps where the wife was ill, and the husband sat
up at night, tending and nursing her although she was
no longer a source of pleasure, but only a source of
trouble and annoyance; that unselfishness grows out
of love, even the animal love, or lust of the possessor,
that remains as a little bit of unselfish seed to bear
flower in Svarga. When he reaches Svarga, and finds
there again the wife and the child he loved, then that
little seed of love begins to grow, and grows through
the life, the heavenly life, of happiness that he leads,
and that is transmuted into a greater power of loving,
which he brings back with him to his next birth,
so that he finds himself on a higher plane of emotion
than that he lived on in the last.</p>

<p>Now in the savage the growth is very slow. Hundreds
of lives sometimes pass and little change is seen.
But where the Sages I spoke of are present, there
the growth is more rapid, for there comes in the
recognition of the law, and the understanding of the
sequence of events. The man comes back again for
many births, until he comes back as an average
common-place semi-civilised man. As a savage, he
has hardly any power of thought; through the lives
that pass the power of thought has grown. And
now, you come to a man who, in a comparatively
civilised country, is born as an ordinary mediocre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
man&mdash;"the man in the street," we often call him.
Now his experience is more varied. He has many
loves and hates, many unjust desires, but also some
higher aspirations; and as he goes through a life, the
result of his own past, he gathers together fresh
experiences, whereof presently more faculty will be
manufactured. Just as a sea-gull, sweeping through
the air, sweeps down into the ocean, catches a
fish, comes up again and flies away to feed upon
the fish, so does the human being, out of the
great expanse of life in the higher world, sweep
down into physical existence to gain the food of
experience there. He carries it away through the
gateway of death, and feeds upon it in the worlds
on the other side of death. Again, more fully and
more subtly than in the early stages of life, he
reaps the result of the evil that he has done; but his
mind is now larger, his mind is more intelligent, he
traces the evil act bringing about the suffering,
and that is imprinted on the tablet of the mind.
Then he goes on into Svarga, and there turns over
the good experience he has gained. The experience
in love-emotion, that turns into higher powers of
loving, greater desire to serve, greater recognition
of the claims of others upon him, until he has
formed a better and higher love-emotion, ready to
return with him to his next experience of life.
But he has also gathered much thought; he has
gained experience in knowledge; he has exerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
mental faculties. He gathers up all the mental
experiences and these he works up into intellectual
faculties. Is it not written that man is created
by thought, and what a man thinks upon
that he becomes? The life of Svarga is a life
of changing experience into faculty. Every experience
that you are making now, intellectual
experience, you will weave into mental power on the
other side of death. Whatever you may have gained,
whatever knowledge you have acquired, that you carry
with you through the gateway of death, and you
work it up into mental power during your life in
Svarga. You may have been weak in some faculty,
in judgment, we will say, and you made many errors
in judgment here: you suffer for them on the other
side of death. You remember them in Svarga, and
you build up that experience into an increased power
of judgment, and you bring that back with you as an
innate quality, and it shows itself in your childhood
as part of your intellectual equipment. And, so with
every faculty, with reason, with memory, with logic,
with the power of understanding; not one of your
efforts here is wasted; they all come back to
you as food-experience in your heavenly life. You
brood over them, you change them into faculty, and
that faculty is yours for evermore. For that passes
on into the intellectual side of the Spirit, as the emotions
pass on into the moral, which is the wisdom
side; and so, you come back to earth with higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
intellectual power, with greater moral faculty. That
continues, on and on, life after life, and when you
are born into the world with high ability, it only
means the many lives you have studied, the many
lives you have laboured in, the many after-death
periods during which you have assimilated.</p>

<p>See how the process resembles your life here,
which is, indeed, its reflection on the physical plane.
You take food; you are satisfied. That food passes
down, and is digested. The nutritive part of that is
assimilated, and your brain, your muscles, your
nerves, all grow by the assimilated nourishment; and
when it is assimilated you begin to feel hungry again.
You have used up what you took, and you are hungry
for more food, in order that you may grow again;
and then, you have again another meal, and the
whole process is repeated.</p>

<p>So in your spiritual life also. You take the food of
experience; you digest it; you assimilate the nutritive
part of it, and by that you unfold the hidden powers
of the Spirit, and, when you have assimilated
all, when nothing remains to be transmuted, then
in the heavenly world you are hungry for more
experience, and your hunger brings you back to
birth in the world in which that hunger can be
satisfied. That is the Law. That is the Law of
Reincarnation.</p>

<p>As you grow more and more in stature, your growth
becomes more rapid. And at last, a time comes, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
you say: "I have had enough of this; I no longer
care for power&mdash;it ends in disappointment; I no
longer care for wealth&mdash;it is a burden rather than a
joy; I no longer care for the things that break in the
enjoyment; I no longer care for the things that perish
in the using." And then there sets in the discontent
with the transitory goods of this world; there sets in
that which is called Vair&#257;gya&mdash;dispassion. The objects
no longer attract; and then the man that has this
Divine discontent within him begins to seek for the
permanent, begins to look for that which will satisfy;
and there is nothing that can satisfy the Divine
Spirit in man save God Himself, the Illimitable Life
and Love. And so, as an English poet wrote&mdash;an
old-fashioned poet:</p>

</div>


                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>
<p>Now that is the truth. There is nothing in all this
world that does not break in your hands, when you
have it. God is like a mother, and He dangles in front
of His children all the joys, the glittering baubles,
that earth can give. And, in front of one He dangles
wealth, saying: "Come, my child, and grasp the
wealth." And the child, in trying to grasp, puts out
his power, and his strength develops, and his will
develops, and in the struggle to be rich many of the
faculties of the man and the power of will are
developed, and when that has been done, and the
child grasps the bauble&mdash;it breaks. For the value was
in the struggle and not in the possession, for the
Divine Spirit in man. The Divine Spirit in man can
never be satisfied with gold or wealth. If a mother
took up her child and carried it always, as some
foolish men would have God carry us, then when
the child ought to be walking, strengthening its legs,
tumbling down and picking itself up again, it would
have been carried in its mother's arms, until when it
was 6 or 7 or 8, it would be paralysed, and would
never grow into a man at all. And so it is with
God's child, Man. "Struggle," He says. "See
all the beautiful things I have here for you." For
God is in all the objects of sense. God is in
everything that attracts; there is no attraction
save in God, the only fair. And so, He
hides Himself in gold, and He hides Himself in
pleasure, and He hides Himself in Power; and He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
hides Himself in fame; and when the child has
exerted himself and gained the desirable object, God
slips out of it and the attraction vanishes, and so we
grow and learn. It is the only way. We grow
strong, intellectually strong, morally strong, until
nothing has power to attract save the one supreme
attraction, God Himself.</p>

<p>And so it is written, that when a man becomes
weary he begins to abstain from the objects of the
senses. And then come the strange words: "The
objects of the senses turn away from the abstemious
dweller in the body." Why? because God is in them,
and when they no longer attract they have done
their work, and they turn away to educate some less
developed man; and then, it is written, that the taste
for them still remains, but even the taste for them
vanishes away when once the Supreme is seen.
There lies the truth. You feel distaste for the
lower only when you have seen the higher. When
you have seen the Supreme Beauty, the fragments
of that Beauty down here can no longer
mislead; you see God in them, and keep a grateful
memory of all that they have taught you, in that
they have led to the realisation of the God hidden in
them, the treasure which remains. When you have
gained the knowledge, the realisation of God, what
has earth left, that earth can give? He is all power;
He is all might; He is all beauty; He is all love; and
you learn to know that nothing that has attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
you can perish in its permanent reality. Although the
form may break, and change into another, it only increases
your treasure in the riches of the Supreme.
You love a woman; it is well; for love is the great
purifier and the great uplifter of human hearts; but
remember that her loveliness is but a fragment of the
Divine Loveliness, and that all that attracts in her is
the beauty of the Self shining forth through the
beauty of the form.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Not for the sake of the wife is the wife dear, but for
the sake of the Self the wife is dear; not for the sake of
the husband is the husband dear, but for the sake of
the Self the husband is dear; not for the sake
of the son is the son dear, but for the sake of the Self
the son is dear.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>But the wife and the husband and the son are
rightly dear, because there is dwelling in them the
glory of the Self, and that remains for ever, with all
that has made it beautiful to you on earth; for God
is Love, and love can never die; and all the loving
and beloved J&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257;s, that have been embodied in
many forms, remain as your companions through
the everlasting ages of the Future.</p>

<p>Now when a man has learnt Vair&#257;gya, then comes
the great period of Service. No longer does he work
for anything for himself, but to carry out the Divine
Will in Evolution. Has not Shr&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;h&#7751;a said that
He acts perpetually? Because, "if I do not act," He
says, "all these worlds would perish." "I have
nothing to gain," are His words. But they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
perish, save for Him, and He goes on to say: "Let
the wise man, acting with me, render all action
attractive." Action is only a clog, is only a fetter,
after man has gained all its fruit in experience, when
it is not done for the sake of sacrifice. But when
the action is consecrated to the Service of God and
Man, that action becomes wings that uplift, and
not fetters that clog, the advancing Spirit. And
so, in the arrangement of castes that we have
in India, there is one great lesson that comes
out. The Sh&#363;&#7693;ra, the lowest caste, is the man who
serves all. But the highest, above all castes, the
Sanny&#257;s&#299;, what is he but the Servant of humanity, reproducing
on a loftier plane the Service in which a
Sh&#363;&#7693;ra is taking his first lesson down here? The
Sh&#363;&#7693;ra learns service to others, and accumulates what
he learns; the Vaishya learns to sacrifice material
wealth in charity to others; the K&#7779;ha&#7789;&#7789;riya learns to
renounce life itself in defence of others; the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
learns to renounce all for knowledge, that he may
teach others. Then caste has taught its lessons, and
the highest of all services are the services done for
the sake of sacrifice by the liberated Spirit, the
Paramahamsa, the man who has gone beyond the
illusion of the Separated Self. So wisely was planned
the ancient order, full of true significance.</p>

<p>The only other point that you have to remember is
that all this is done under inviolable Law. "As you
sow, so shall you reap." There is a great verse in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Christian Scripture too often forgotten by Christians:
"Be not deceived; God is not mocked; whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap." No use
for substitution; no putting on of an imputed
righteousness; no safety by a Saviour; you must
reap your own harvest, you must work out,
earn, your own salvation for yourself. But this
remember: that your only limitation in taking up the
strength of God lies in you, and not in Him. That is
where the doctrine of so-called Divine Grace comes
in. As the Sun shines all around you, as the Sun
shines upon your house, you may close all the
shutters, and say: "I don't want light; I shut my
windows and my doors against the incoming rays of
the Sun." So may you say to the Supreme Sun, the
Light and the Life of the Universe: "I shut against
you the doors of my heart; I don't want you to
penetrate within me. I close my doors; I close my
windows; your light shall not illuminate my Soul."
And the answer of the Divine is: "Behold, I stand
at the door and knock; if any man open, I will come
in." There lies what men call Divine Grace. The
grace is ever there, shining upon your closed shutters.
You may shut your door; there is no change in
the effulgence of the Sun. And so there is the Divine
Light ever around you. You turn your backs
upon it, and you say that it is dark; you have
refused to see the Light, and you dwell in the shadow
that you yourselves have made. Well, stay there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45&ndash;46</a></span>
as long as you will. Play with the toys, as long as it
pleases you. But know, that the day will come when
the breaking of the toys will leave you desolate, and
then you will open your hearts to the Supreme Love,
and say: "Light, come in, and fill my heart with
Thyself, for Thou and I are one, we were never separate;
and I, the child of Man, recognise my birthright,
and I claim, in the Self-realisation of my
Divinity, the fruition of my life as Man."</p>

<h2>RIGHT AND WRONG</h2>
</div>

<p class="sigleft in0"><span class="smcap">Friends</span>:</p>

<p>The problem that we have to consider this
morning is one of great complexity and of great
difficulty. Confusion as to "What is Right," as to
"What is Wrong," is unfortunately very general
among all, even among educated people. The standard
of Right, the canon of Right, that is a matter that
ought to be placed on some definite principle,
some intelligible axiom; and, if instead of such
definite foundation, you do not realise on what
the standard is based, the result is necessarily a
confusion of conduct, a doubt as to how Right
and Wrong are to be determined. And so, sometimes,
almost in despair of a rationally intelligible
law, you find people saying that Right is absolute, is
always the same invariably for man at all stages of
evolution. The result of that has been, both in
the East and in the West, that a standard of
conduct laid down for the Yog&#299;, the Sanny&#257;s&#299; is held
to be the standard to be held up before the comparatively
undeveloped man. The Sermon on the Mount,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
among Christians; the teaching of the <i>Bhagava&#7693;-G&#299;&#7789;&#257;</i>,
of action without desire for fruit, among Hin&#7693;&#363;s; these
are regarded as universally binding; and the result is a
divorce between theory and practice, between the
conduct which is actually followed and the theory
which is intellectually accepted. You find a striking
instance of that in the West, where the Sermon on
the Mount, nominally regarded as binding on every
one, is entirely put aside as regards the vast majority,
and is held to have no bearing on National conduct, or
the treatment of one Nation by another. You find,
for instance, a Bishop of the Church of England
who declared that if any Nation followed the
teaching of the Sermon on the Mount it could
not exist for a week. That is literally true. For
if, when a man stole your coat, you gave him your
cloak, the result would be that the thief would be
doubly clothed, the honest man would go naked.
If, when a man was struck on the one cheek, he
turned to the striker the other cheek, then the
oppressor and the tyrant would have free course,
and the doctrine of non-resistance of evil would
triumph over the resistance which means liberty and
progress. And so, in the West, which has as a rule
a fair amount of common-sense, and is not too much
given to logic in practical matters, they resist evil,
they resist the oppressor, they strike back when a
blow is given, and they do not submissively bow to
every tyrant and every injustice. Yet, unless you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
bring into accord theory and practice, you have no
rule of conduct which in any way is an inspiration
for life. Similarly in the East, where the doctrine
is taught in the <i>G&#299;&#7789;&#257;</i> that action should be undertaken
without desire for fruit. There you have a
doctrine for the Yog&#299;, like Arjuna, to whom the
Song of the Lord was given; but if you say to
the man of the world, if you say to the man who does
not regard the Divine Will as the binding rule of conduct,
"work without desire for fruit," you paralyse his
activity, for there is no other motive sufficiently strong
to move him to action. To work without desire for
fruit means that your own will is so consciously in
accord with the Will of God, that you work as
earnestly for the benefit of the world as the ordinary
man works for fame, for power, or for money. That
is the highest rule of conduct; but if you teach the
highest to the half-developed, you give them no ideal
at all which is practical, by which they can guide
their lives; and the result of that in India has been a
paralysis of action, and a yielding unduly to
oppression and injustice, as the Sanny&#257;s&#299; would
yield. Now Hin&#7693;&#363;ism, as taught by the Sages, was
not of that type. Hin&#7693;&#363;ism has always had a
relative morality. The whole of that part of its
teaching which divided society into castes according
to evolution, the unfolding of the spiritual life,
is a recognition that &#7693;harma, duty, depends on
the stage of evolution reached by the man. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
&#7693;harma of the Sh&#363;&#7693;ra is not the &#7693;harma of the
K&#7779;ha&#7789;&#7789;riya or of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. The K&#7779;ha&#7789;&#7789;riya is
to keep order, he is to repress evil, he is to encourage
good, he is to punish the wrong-doer; but the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, the ideal Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, he ought to suffer
any wrong done to him, for it is not his &#7693;harma to
resist. And so, it is written, that a man by following
his own &#7693;harma, he attaineth to perfection. That it
is better to follow your own &#7693;harma though imperfect,
than to follow the &#7693;harma of another, for the &#7693;harma
of another is full of danger. That has been forgotten
in India, though, nominally, the caste system has
persisted. And so, with the teaching of the &#256;shramas;
the duty of the student, the Brahmach&#257;r&#299;, is
not the duty of the G&#7771;has&#7789;ha, the householder, and
when that is forgotten and when the duties of the
householder are put on the shoulders of the student,
you have then a debilitated race of youth that is not
allowed to grow to the stature of manhood which
follows youthful celibacy. The duty of the householder
is not the duty of the V&#257;napras&#7789;ha; the
duty of the V&#257;napras&#7789;ha is not the duty of the
Sanny&#257;s&#299;; for the Sages, the &#7770;&#7779;his that built
the foundation of Hin&#7693;&#363;ism, they knew that morality
was relative, and gave an evolving ethical
teaching suited to the evolving children of Man.
Let us then, with that preface, try to find some
common principle to which we can refer Right and
Wrong.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>Realise, first of all, what morality means. I give
it the definition that I have given elsewhere:
"Morality is the Science of harmonious relations
between intelligent beings." There is no morality
for the mineral; there is no morality for the vegetable;
there is no morality for the animal. Those are
in the group under evolutionary law which compels
them to go forward by the tremendous struggle for
existence. By that struggle certain qualities are
evolved&mdash;the qualities which are the bases of the
humanity which is to be born into the world. There is a
stage where there is no morality; where the creature
is not immoral, but, is not-moral, is unmoral&mdash;without
morality. He has not reached the stage where
conscious obedience to law is possible for him; and so,
as he is without the knowledge of good and evil, you
cannot claim from him obedience to a law of Right and
Wrong. Not only so, but taking that as our first
point&mdash;that there is a stage where morality cannot
exist because of the want of self-consciousness&mdash;the
next point that you must realise, in establishing a
Science of Morality, is a clear understanding of the
meaning of the word "law". Now "law" may be
a command made by a human legislature, or made
arbitrarily by the ruler of a Nation, changeable,
therefore, with an arbitrary penalty attached to its
transgression. But the moral law, like all laws of
Nature, is not a command either to do, or not to do.
It is a declaration of conditions which produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
certain definite results. Chemical law does not tell
you, you <i>must</i> put hydrogen and oxygen together and
produce water. You may produce water or not as
you like; you are perfectly free to make it or not to
make it; but the law is that if you put hydrogen
and oxygen together at a certain temperature
under a certain pressure, then you must produce
water. It is a statement of conditions, followed
by unchangeable result. A law of Nature, therefore,
is not violable. You cannot change it.
Nothing can prevent the formation of water, if
only the conditions for its production are present.
Nothing can ever produce water unless the
conditions for its production are present. You
cannot change it; that is a law. But, according to
your knowledge of law is your freedom in a realm of
law. The ignorant man goes about in Nature buffeted
by her laws, crushed by some, helped by others; to
him the happenings are matters of chance, for he
knows not the laws amid which he lives. Cabined,
crippled, rendered helpless, he stands before an
inexorable Nature, and knows not how, or whither,
he should move. But the man of knowledge,
knowing the laws around him, walks with perfect
freedom in a realm of law; he balances one law
against another, he utilises laws that help, he
neutralises laws that oppose him, and in proportion to
his knowledge is his freedom; for, as it has well been
said: "Nature is conquered by obedience." Obeying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
he is free. Now the moral law is a natural law,
not an artificial one. It is an expression, as are all
the laws of Nature, of &#298;shvara, who is the life, the
sustenance, of His Universe. The moral law cannot
be broken; the moral law cannot be changed; it is the
will of God in Evolution; and, by that alone may Right
and Wrong be tested. That is Right which helps
evolution forward; that is Wrong which opposes the
Divine Will in Evolution. There is your standard, or
canon, of Right and Wrong. Oh! you say, that is
not a rough and ready definition, or standard. No;
it requires knowledge. And so the &#7770;&#7779;his, the great
Teachers, have given certain commands&mdash;morals to
be followed by the ignorant, based on the one
supreme law of conformity to the Divine Will in
Evolution. We are told by Vy&#257;sa: "To do good to
another is Right; to do evil to another is Wrong."
We are told by the Christ: "Do unto others as ye
would that they should do to you." But take those
two moral commands, and see whether under all
circumstances they should be obeyed. As a rough
rule of conduct&mdash;yes; for the masses of people&mdash;yes;
but can a King obey Christ's command, or a Judge
"do unto others as" he "would that they should do
unto" him? When he has a murderer before him in
the dock, and he sits to administer the law of the
land, may he say: "I must do to the murderer as I
would that he should do to me, and I must not sentence
him to punishment because I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
wish to be so sentenced"? All these general
commands as to action are limited in their scope,
are modified by surrounding conditions, depend on
the position of the person. You and I have no right
to lock up in a room another person because he has
injured us; but the Judge has the duty of locking
him up, if he has transgressed the law of the land
and prison is the appointed punishment. Another
precept was given by a very practical man, Confucius.
He was asked: "How shall we behave? What
word is there which defines our duty? shall we
return good for evil, as the great Sage L&#226;o-tsze
has declared?" And Confucius, being a practical
statesman, answered: "Is not 'Reciprocity' such a
word? If you return good for evil, with what
will you recompense good? Recompense good with
good, and evil with justice." Now there you have the
law of the State. The law of forgiveness, the law of
returning good for evil, is the law for the man aspiring
to lead a spiritual life. It is a duty on the Path
of Holiness; it is a duty of one aspiring to become a
Saint or a Yog&#299;. It is the law for the individual conduct
which raises the man from the brute to the God;
but for the State, that is not the law. For the Nation,
the stage of evolution has not yet been reached which
can return good for evil, and allow an enemy to overrun
the country and to have his will upon the people.</p>

<p>And so, in dealing with morality, as in dealing with
every Science, you must use your brains as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
your emotions, and you must judge the consequence
of actions in order to guide your path.</p>

<p>Looking then at it in this way, we must see what
"evolution" means. It means that at first progress is
secured by inviolable laws of Nature, that press upon
a whole class. As I said, the mineral, the vegetable,
the animal, they cannot resist the law; they cannot
evade it; they are compelled by an inner instinct to
conform themselves to the law of their nature,
imprinted upon them by the hand of &#298;shvara
Himself, and so you have no mental struggle. The
wild beast in the forest, he develops keenness,
swiftness, shrewdness, cunning, because without
them, he perishes. When you come to the savage,
the law of evolution is very much the same. The
savage is without the knowledge of good or of
evil, and that is recognised everywhere. Most
of you will know the Jewish legend, how God created
a man and a woman and placed them in a garden,
so that they might enjoy the fruit of every tree in
the garden save the one tree that was forbidden,
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Then
comes in the curious point that God gives His
creatures a command: "You shall not eat of that
tree"; but, having no knowledge of good and evil,
they could not know that disobedience was evil and
that obedience was good; and, as the fruit was
attractive and desirable, they ate and gained the
knowledge, which they had been forbidden to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
acquire. And so you have the curious condition
that the "fall of man" is brought about by his
ignorance of Right and Wrong; he does the Wrong
unconsciously, and so gains the knowledge of distinction
between good and evil. Now while it would
be a terrible injustice that their ignorance should be
counted as a sin, for which any of us, their descendants,
should perish everlastingly, yet if you
look on the story as a symbolical representation
of fact, it becomes most illuminative and helpful.
For the first stage in the emergence of the
human race from the innocence and the ignorance
of the animal and the animal-man lies in the
experience of good and of evil, which brings
happiness in assonance with the law and unhappiness
in discord with the law. The savage knows no
Right or Wrong. You remember the most typical
case of the Missionary, who wanted to point out to
an Australian savage that he should not, when he
was hungry, have eaten his wife. He was short of
food, the poor man, and was very very hungry; his
wife was the handiest form of food; he killed her
and ate her. "Oh!" but said the Missionary: "That
was very wrong," and as there was no word in the
savage's language for "wrong," he said: "That
was not good." "I assure you," said the innocent
savage, "she was very good." There was no idea
there of any "good" except physical gratification,
and as the flesh of the wife stilled the hunger of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
man, "she was very good," he answered. Now
there was no Right or Wrong there. The man was
unmoral; he only knew the gratification of his own
desires; he followed them blindly; but that, as with
Adam and Eve, was the road to progress. He would
want his wife presently, and he would miss her. The
gratification of hunger was a momentary pleasure,
but the presence of the wife was a continual help and
service. And so, presently, that man would think
that it was a mistake to kill her: "I had better
have been hungry for a few more hours, and have
kept my wife." And the first idea dawns upon him
that the gratification of a momentary want is not the
path to a lasting happiness. Both are temporary, of
course, but one is longer than the other. Now the
first lessons of the savage come along that line. The
white man gives the savage drink; the savage likes
it; he gets drunk; but he finds in the morning that
he has a very bad headache; if the attraction of the
drink is greater than the fear of headache, he goes on
drinking and drinking, until he dies perhaps in
delirium tremens. And looking at it all, after death,
the savages profit by that; and they say: "This
drink makes us ill; this drink shortens our life; this
drink brings unhappiness at last"; and they learn
after very many such experiences that intoxication is
Wrong; but they cannot learn this without the experience.
They cannot gain knowledge without knowing the
pair of opposites, one of which is good and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
evil; and all the first evolution of the savage depends
on his gathering experience, which shows him that
going with the law of health means happiness in the
physical sense, going against it means unhappiness.
Now the savage takes a very long time to learn this.
But he is not left, as I pointed out to you yesterday,
only to the gathering of experience. Some wise man,
the Founder of a religion, or nowadays a Christian or
Musalm&#257;n Missionary, says: "Don't touch drink; it
will make you miserable." He breaks the command.
How many Hin&#7693;&#363;s, how many Musalm&#257;ns to-day, forbidden
by their religions to take strong drink, break
the religious command and suffer thereby. How many
Princes of R&#257;jpu&#7789;&#257;na have died in middle age owing
to excessive drinking; so that you find a number of
young Princes succeeding to the gadi, their fathers
having fallen victims to the curse of European drink.
The old Princes in R&#257;jpu&#7789;&#257;na, Musalm&#257;n and Hin&#7693;&#363;,
are the men who have followed the law of their religion,
and have abstained from strong drink. Is that
not a lesson to the younger men who follow them?
You can see the result of the lesson in the improved
temperance of the younger generation of Indian
Princes to-day. They have learnt the lesson by the
experience of others, instead of by the bitter fruit of
experience in themselves.</p>

<p>For the elders who have died, not only is there
the command given by a religion, but there is the
experience on the other side of death. Now of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the miseries which can follow a man into the world
after death, of all the miseries, the results of
drink are perhaps almost the most terrible. There
is a constant craving, for not in the physical
body but in the senses of the S&#363;k&#7779;hma Shar&#299;ra, lie
the craving, the desire, the longing for sensual
gratification; and, if a man has been drunken, if he
has been profligate in his life, he finds himself tortured
on the other side of death by the drink he cannot
enjoy, by the craving of the sex instinct which he
cannot gratify. Torn by the agony of longing, frustrated
by the impossibility of gratification, there
is branded on that soul, as with a red-hot iron:
"It is foolish to yield to gratification that brings
about the misery that now I am suffering." He
has to starve out the craving by non-satisfaction,
and the agonies of starvation are his doom.
And so is impressed on the lasting memory of the
man the knowledge that suffering follows on the
undue gratification of the passions of the body.
That comes back in the next life&mdash;or after many
lives&mdash;that comes back in an innate distaste for this
form of sense-gratification. You say: "Would it
not have been better that he should have been
spared this long experience?" Nay, it would not
have been better; for you are only finally rid of a
craving, when you cease to desire that which
gratifies it; and the teaching of pain kills the <i>desire</i>,
whereas the enforced abstinence, not killing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
desire, would ever leave you a prey to the possibility
of temptation. That is why the striking of the transgressor
by the disregarded law, is the veriest mercy
in the long life of Man.</p>

<p>Most of you have been evolved without craving for
drink; most of you, if you have touched it, have
thrown it aside as distasteful. It has no power
over you; it has no attraction for you; you turn
away from it with disgust, as that which cannot
tempt; and the only way of reaching that point is to
have had experience of the evil, and to know that it
is the womb of pain. Now out of this grows one
great lesson for those of you who are more advanced.
You know that sometimes, you who are fathers and
mothers, you know that against all precept, against
all training, against all prayer, your son goes wrong.
You have told him: "My boy, to give way to passion
is ruinous"; you have told him: "If you yield, you
will suffer in your manhood." He disregards your
prayer; he disregards your commands; the wild
youth goes on; he will have his way. In that
moment of parental agony, in that moment of
despair, remember that doctrine of the Omnipresence
of God that I spoke of in the first discourse: "If I go
down into hell, behold, thou art there also," and
realise that God&mdash;who loves your child more than you
can love, more wisely as well as more intensely&mdash;has
allowed that soul to go down into hell in order that
He may meet him there in his degradation and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
agony, and teach him by the lesson of pain, when
he would not learn by the lesson of precept, that
there is a law that none may disregard and live
in happiness. For God is the Pain that comes
to the transgressor from the disregarded law, as He
is the Bliss that comes to the man who is in harmony
with law.</p>

<p>Now if you realise these great truths, you will
understand how morality must change with the upward
evolution of the individual man. When you
see wrong-doing in the undeveloped, when you see
evil in the savage&mdash;whether the savage who is an
anachronism in civilised society, or the savage who
in his own native conditions&mdash;you will realise that
that man is only beginning to learn the lessons of
morality, and must learn them by dashing himself
against the laws he knows not. And so, gradually, he
grows out of the unmoral state into the beginning of
the moral state, when he knows a little distinction between
Right and Wrong, and often chooses the Wrong,
because of the temporary pleasure that the yielding
to the Wrong affords. And then he has the lesson
I have just spoken of, until, within his innermost
nature, he has branded the evil to be avoided. Now
it is no merit to any one of us that we do not murder
a man. We do not want to do so, because we
have done it very often in the past, and have
found that the fruit thereof was pain. We do
not want to do it now, and the not wanting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
do a particular wrong is the proof of moral growth. I
know how often we are inclined to say: "Oh! How
admirable is the man who struggles against evil."
Yes. It is admirable for a man to struggle against
temptation, to see him fighting against his lower
nature. He is a hero in the struggle. But greater
than the man who struggles is the man who has
transcended the struggle, and who does the Right
naturally, because he loves the Law and feels no
inclination to turn towards wrong. That is not so
often remembered. The man who has conquered in
past lives, the man who has risen above the temptations
that his younger brother struggles against, he
is at a higher stage of evolution, for he chooses with
full conviction the concord with the will of God.
That means that the Divine Will in his own Spirit is
emerging, and that quality, the Divine Will in the
man, is the sign of approaching Liberation.</p>

<p>Come to another point, where you do not know in
a particular case, what is Right and what is Wrong.
To the more developed man, it is no longer a conflict
between the "Right and Wrong" that he knows. It
is a conflict between two duties, and he does not know
whether of the twain is the one that he should follow.
There you come to the agony of the opening Spirit,
the unfolding God within, who is faced by two
paths, and knows not which is the right one. Some
arguments on one side, some arguments on the other.
"Which of the two paths shall I take? How may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
I know what is the will of God?" That is the agony
of the Soul whose will is set to the Right, but who
does not know the Right under the conditions which
surround him. What does it mean? It means that
he lacks experience. For Conscience, that which
tells you "this is Right, that is Wrong," is only
the accumulated experience of your past, which has
registered certain facts in the nature that you
bring into the world with you as that fruit of
experience. You have murdered&mdash;you have suffered;
you are born with the instinct that murder
is wrong. You have robbed&mdash;you have suffered;
you are born with the instinct that theft
is wrong. That does not exist in the savage.
Take a savage child, and you will find that
your precepts carry him up to a certain point,
and you can go no further. You can awaken
in him the result of past experience, but you
cannot give him a Conscience, an experience, which
he has not yet acquired. But you, you have a
great fund of Conscience, a compelling voice, which
says: "kill not," "steal not," "don't give way to
lust which injures another"; you take it for
granted that is Right, and that knowledge is the
outcome of your past experience. But now, you do
not know what is Right and what is Wrong. Why?
Because, you have not had the experience to enable
you to judge in a new condition, to enable you to see
the Right in an environment that you have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
in before. When a fresh step forward is to be taken,
when a new knowledge is to be gained, what shall
you do? You have to act. First, use your best
intelligence; think as far as you can. Then try to put
aside the bias which the inner desire is apt to
imprint upon your thinking. Try to put aside
all questions of personal gain, all questions of
personal loss, everything which makes you more
inclined to take one path or the other. It is a
difficult thing to do, and it implies considerable
training before you can thus neutralise the inner
desires of your nature. Do your best; and then
having used your intelligence, having put aside your
desires, try, in that tranquillity of mind and senses,
lifting up your heart to God, or Master, to see which
is the higher path. Sometimes an inner voice will
whisper to you and give you guidance; sometimes a
&#7692;eva may help you and suggest the better path;
sometimes you are left to find your own way. Having
done your best, decide; and when you have decided,
act; for you have done all you can. Then watch
the results; see what is the outcome of your decision;
and you will discover by that outcome whether you
judged rightly or wrongly. If you judged wrongly,
do not regret. You did your best, and you have
gained a new experience by the blunder, and it will
help you in the future. If you have done right, you
are stronger for the future; you have solved a new
problem and gained a new knowledge. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
you may come to a point in your evolution, where
you have to face the question of following your
conviction of the inner law of Right against every
impulse that presses you to take a lower path. You
have grown to the point where new ideals attract.
You have begun to realise that the claim of humanity
is greater than the claim of individuals with whom you
are connected. You have come to the point to
which all must come, to the point where to follow the
Right is martyrdom, and where to follow the Wrong
is easy and is regarded as praiseworthy by those
around you. My Brother, if you have come to that
point, be glad with exceeding joy; for it means that
you have gone beyond the normal evolution of your
race, and that which is Right to the men and women
around you has become Wrong to you, who have
caught a glimpse of a higher law. And then, surely
comes the question: "Will you stand by the fruit of
your glimpse, alone, unhelped, unsupported, unregarded?
Will you follow Conscience that bids
you take the path alone, or will you follow the
voice of the multitude, still at a lower range of
evolution?" It is the choice of the Hero; it is
the choice of the Martyr. Better to die, you
will feel, than to bow to a lower law than that
which your Spirit has learnt to recognise. To
tell a lie is to be debased; to tell a lie is to lose
the vision of Truth; to tell a lie is to put a bandage
round your eyes, and to refuse to see that which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
already glimpsed. And if for you it is easier to face
calumny, ostracism, the cold shoulder of friends, the
hatred of Governments, and, if against all these things,
you say: "It is easier to suffer than to lie," then
you are taking your place amidst earth's Heroes, and
you are serving your day and generation. But make
no mistake; the choice is not as easy as it seems.
The worst enemy of the martyr and the hero is the
inner enemy, not the outer&mdash;the love that pleads
with you to falter in your duty; worse than all, the
inner doubt. "Can I really be Right, when every one
around me tells me I am Wrong? Can I alone see
what ought to be done? All these good men and women,
honourable, faithful, good citizens of the world,
tell me that I am mistaken and headlong. Is it
not conceit, is it not vanity, to set my solitary choice
against the wisdom of the aged, against the
experience of my time?" Ah! that is a worse enemy
than any outside pressure, for the outer you can
resist, but the inner saps the very essence of your
strength; the time comes when you are able to say:
"Right or Wrong, whether it leads me to heaven
or to hell, I follow the Inner Voice, which is the
best guide I have; and, if it leads me wrong to-day,
I shall know the Right by my blunder to-morrow."
I know that means courage beyond the normal, but
that is the courage that the Martyrs have shown,
and posterity rewards them, if contemporaries destroy
them. For it is true, as Giordano Bruno said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
going to the stake: "To know how to die in one
century is to live for all centuries to come." And so,
again, he taught what he called "the heroic life".
"It is better to try nobly and to fail, than ignobly
not to try at all." That is the great inspiration
for those who have caught a glimpse of the
higher. Follow your own higher, whatever it
may be, and whithersoever it may lead you; for the
inspiration comes from the highest yet manifest within
you, and not to follow it is to be a traitor to the
Truth you see. Thus, by study of the Divine Will
in Evolution, by trying to see where one stands in
the long climbing upwards, every man ultimately,
must be the supreme and final judge of Right and
Wrong for himself.</p>

<p>But remember: you should not blame your neighbour
because he does not see with your eyes. You
should not despise those who think you are wrong,
but weigh their blame, and see how much of reason
there is therein. Remember also that in this struggle
upwards, full weight should be given to the experience
of the race as well as to your own. You should
not despise nor flout those laws which keep the mass
of the people in the path of decency and of good
citizenship, and you should remember the warning of
Shr&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;h&#7751;a, so pre-eminently wise: "The standard
that the wise man sets, by that the people go." To
take your own road alone means a tremendous
responsibility, as well as an act of heroism, for others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
may follow, unknowing, where you have deliberately
chosen your path. Others less prepared by self-discipline
and training may rush in after you where
you have opened the gateway; and so, in your action,
by which the blind must judge you, you must
consider your circumstances as well as your vision of
the Best. Only when to yield is treason to the
Highest in you, should you set yourself alone against
the world. "Tangled," said Shr&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;h&#7751;a, "Tangled
is the path of action," and that is true. Therefore
you must develop your intellect; therefore you must
train your will; therefore you must try to illuminate
your judgment; no headlong, thoughtless action
must be taken on the first impulse towards an
unaccustomed path.</p>

<p>There is one thing that I have often said, and
that I will here repeat, especially for my younger
friends, whom I welcome to our meetings here. I
would say to them: If you want advice, and ask:
"Shall I disobey the customary law, and go my own
way?"&mdash;then wait. The wanting of advice is the sign
that the Spirit in you has not yet spoken with the compelling
voice that you ought to obey. I have had boys
come to me and say: "Shall I disobey my father? this
refusal to obey seems to be the right path." My answer
invariably has been: "My boy, if you are doubtful,
as you must be since you ask me, then obey your
father and mother, and see what the result is; for,
when the Spirit speaks, no outside advice is wanted."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
The great decisions of the Spirit are made in solitude,
and they are not made by the advice of man. If you
want others to support you, if you want the opinion
of others to buttress you up, then the chances are,
when the moment of stress comes upon you, you will
quiver, you will say to your adviser: "Oh! you have
advised me to do this; see what trouble it has
brought, and I must suffer for it." And so, I
have never advised, nor will advise, a great act of
sacrifice. O crowd of thoughtful men and women, I say
to you: "Choose your highest and follow it unflinchingly."
But if any one of you comes to me and
says: "Shall I sacrifice this? shall I sacrifice that?
shall I disregard the other?" I say: "My friends,
the decision is with you and not with me. Your own
conscience must guide you. Your own intelligence
must direct you. As I cannot suffer for you, I will
not advise." For one has no right to impose upon
another a sacrifice one is willing to face for one's self.
I know my own strength and weakness. I am
accustomed by many lives of aspiration to judge what
path I shall follow. But shall I follow the path that
I see to be Right for me, the path of suffering, and
invite others to enter on it, who may not be prepared
to face the pain? No; the decision towards pain must
be made by the open vision of the one who affronts the
suffering; otherwise, in the stress of the agony he may
wish he had chosen the easier and the smoother path.
The pioneer must know his strength; the pioneer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
must be ready for the stones that pierce his feet, for
the thorns that tear his flesh. Let no weakling
enter on the path of that higher, more strenuous,
endeavour. We want pioneers. But we want
pioneers of courage, of heart, of strength, of endurance,
that no danger can daunt, that no peril can
paralyse. Only such are worthy to come into
the ranks of the pioneers, who make the path along
which humanity shall march in days to come.
And if you say to me: "Why should we go? Why
should we suffer that others may tread smooth? Why
should our flesh be torn that others may walk in
ease?"&mdash;my answer is: "Unless the Spirit is so
unfolded in you that the path of progress is to you
the path of happiness, so that when the feet are
bleeding, when the flesh is tortured, you can look
up with a smile and say: 'Lord, I have come to do
Thy will'; until the path to you is the only path of
happiness, you had better tread the accustomed ways
of the men and women around you."</p>

<p>For there is a time in evolution, when all wish for
aught the world can give has vanished from the
human Spirit; when there is no desire for aught
save that God's will may be done on earth, as it
is done in the higher realms of wisdom; when
to be allowed to suffer in order that that Will
may be done is a joy beyond all earthly joy,
is a delight beyond anything that the world can
give. Realise that the Martyr and the Hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71&ndash;72</a></span>
die, because death is the most joyous thing that
they can meet, knowing that by their death the
world's progress is improved. Unless you feel this
in you, then travel along the road that for you is
Right; for the consent of the intelligence, the consent
of the conscience, the realisation of God, these alone
are the strength of the Hero; these, in the midst
of the very flames of martyrdom, enable him to
smile with joy, for vision of the future that he sees.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>BROTHERHOOD</h2>
</div>

<p class="sigleft in0"><span class="smcap">Friends</span>:</p>

<p>We have arrived now at the last of the four Convention
Lectures, and I will ask you to recall for a moment
the path that we have trodden on these three days.</p>

<p>First you remember we considered the nature, the
existence of God, His all-pervading Presence, His
all-embracing Love and Power. Then we turned to
the study of Man, and we saw that man evolved,
grew from a Seed of Divinity into the tree in the
likeness of the father-tree, whence the seed was
thrown into the world. That he evolved under two
great Laws: the "Law of Reincarnation" and the
"Law of Causation, or Karma". Yesterday, we
considered the complex problem of Right and Wrong,
tried to understand the tangled path of action, and to
understand also how, by realising our highest capacities
of the moment, we could rise higher and higher in
Knowledge, in Power, and in Love. To-day we close
our study by looking at the "Law of Brotherhood,"
trying to understand what it means, seeing what it
implies, endeavouring then, in the understanding, to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the principles on which a stable Society may be builded,
and to glance forward into the near future of
Humanity, with the changed ideals which will illuminate
the Coming Race.</p>

<p>Now, this word, "Brotherhood," has been used
for many ages and held to cover many different
ideals. First of all, let us take the fact that
"Brotherhood" does not and cannot connote equality,
save in blood, in essence; rather does it connote
inequality of age and development. As
you know, you have the proclamation talked of so
much in the French Revolution, "Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity," and it has been taken for granted
by many that Liberty and Fraternity imply the
middle term, Equality. Now what is meant by
the word "Equality"? If it be meant that all
men are equal in their origin, that every man is
born of the Divine Nature, that every man ultimately
will reach the manifested Divinity, in that
sense Equality is true. We all come forth from
God, we all return to God, bearing with us the
harvest of our long evolution, having unfolded
potentiality into power. In the beginning and
the ending, men are equal, equally divine in their
beginning, equally divine in their ending; there
all men stand on a common platform. But in the
long course of evolution from the seed to the full-grown
tree, in the long unfolding of Divinity, of God
manifest in the flesh, in the long changing struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
between Spirit and Matter, there the races of
mankind stand at different stages of their pilgrimage,
and they are not on a common level, but are divorced
the one from the other: While in Spirit all men are
equal, in the flesh men are radically unequal; for
Nature, in her long evolution, knows nothing of
equality, and protests continually by facts against the
theory of the eighteenth and the early nineteenth
century. Where is the equality between the man of
genius and the fool? Where is the equality between
the stalwart and healthy man and the man who has
inherited a terrible disease? Where is the equality
between the cripple and the athlete? Between the
Saint who has nearly accomplished his pilgrimage,
and the savage who stands at the beginning? It is of
no use to repeat a phrase that flies in the very face
of facts and of Nature. Brotherhood connotes inequality
of age, inequality of capacity, and inequality of
duty. The duty of the elder brother is not
the duty of the babe in the cradle. You do
not crush the infant of a year old with the heavy
burden of the family that lies on the elder brother,
who has passed out into the struggle of life; and
you need to get rid of the cant of a phrase and to
understand the reality of life. You have to realise
that the most that can be asked&mdash;because the most
that is possible&mdash;in the building up of Society, is that
no man shall artificially, by a man-made law or
custom, be placed at an unfair disadvantage so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
those around him are concerned, but that there shall
be equality before the law, equality of rich and
poor before the law, equality of every citizen in
the face of the law. Moreover, you ought to make
it your ideal to give to every man equal opportunities;
but you must remember that the radical
inequality lies <i>in the power to grasp an opportunity</i>
when it comes; there is the radical natural
inequality that no human society and no human
law can obviate.</p>

<p>But if you realise Brotherhood then you come to
a new conception. You imagine the building of a
social system, in which every man who is born into
it shall have the opportunity of developing every
faculty he brings with him into the world. A
social system wherein from every member of the
Society there shall be demanded social service
according to his capacity, and to every member shall
be given social helping according to his needs.
You change the law of struggle into the law of
life; you change the brute law of the struggle for
existence into the social law of sacrifice. You
begin to realise, as Huxley said, quoting a statement
of a Master, an Indian &#7770;&#7779;hi, that while the brute
progresses by the law of the survival of the fittest,
the man progresses by the law of self-sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>1</sup></a> There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
you come to the higher ideal and you see that in an
elder brother there is inequality of age, and therefore
inequality of capacity, therefore inequality of power,
and therefore inequality of duty. By the law of love,
the strong exist not for tyranny but for service, and
where the weakest members are found there the
tenderest compassion protects them, and saves them
from being trampled under foot. Therefore was it
said by one of the great Prophets of our race, by the
Christ of Jud&#230;a: "Let the greatest among you be
as he that doth serve." Great is the strength evolved,
but for helping not for trampling; and so the
inequalities of Nature are redressed by an infinite
compassion.</p>

<p>Let us see how in the ancient world these principles,
or the denial of these principles, has worked. Now
the ancient ideal of Kingship is drawn from the perfect
example in the great White Brotherhood of the &#7770;&#7779;his
of the race, wherein you find a graded order. They
call themselves the "Elder Brothers" of mankind.
Those whom we call Masters, because of Their greatness,
They love better the name of Elder Brothers on
whom lies the duty of guidance, of protection, of
helping, in order that the younger brothers of our
Humanity may come to stand where They are standing.
There is the perfect Brotherhood. These, older
in evolution than ourselves, wiser because of that
longer evolution, these J&#299;vanmuk&#7789;as, these liberated
Spirits, They, who are free by right, become bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
our earth by love. They remain waiting for the
growth of Their younger brethren; They use Their
wisdom to guide them; They use Their power to
protect them; They use Their age to strengthen and
sustain them. There is the ideal of Brotherhood,
where Brother means the Servant of mankind.</p>

<p>And from that early recognition of the Elders in
the childhood of the Root Races of the world, you
come to the first great historical exemplification, the
Divine Dynasties, the Divine Kings, as you find them
in Egypt, as you find them in India, to go no further
back to that earlier civilisation of the fourth Race,
where in the City of the Golden Gate, of which the
Chinese tell us, the Divine Emperor ruled with
mighty power, and built the great Toltec race into a
world-wide dominion. I will not go back so far, nor
will I pause on Egypt, because here, in India, we
have in the still living literature of the ancient days,
the duties laid down which fall upon the Elder Brother
in a Nation, who in those ancient days was the
recognised King of the people. You find ideal Kings,
like Shr&#299; R&#257;machan&#7693;ra, and you can see in His
life, as you can see in the description of the duty
of the King, what, from the standpoint of the Elder
Brothers of the race, was meant by the position of
the King. His life is not a life of enjoyment,
but of service and of sacrifice. It is written, that the
King remains awake, in order that his subjects may
sleep; that the King toils, in order that his subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
may enjoy; that the King faces danger, in order
that his people may be protected; that he is the
Supporter of the State, the Guardian of the weak,
the Dispenser of Justice to his people, the Father
of the fatherless, and the Husband of the widow.
And so in early days the &#7770;&#7779;hi comes to the
court of the King, and questions him how he is
ruling his younger brothers. "Have you seen," asked
N&#257;ra&#7693;a, when He came to a later dynasty, no
longer divine; "have you seen that the artisans are
provided with all the materials that they need for
their manufactures and industries? Have you seen
that the agriculturists have a store of seeds, that they
are provided with water, and with agricultural
implements? Do you take care that your soldiers
receive their wages? Do you take care that the
widows and orphans of those who have died for you
in battle are well provided for and carefully tended?"
And so, this Elder Brother of the race, coming to
this man, divine no longer, but only a human copy of
the once manifested Divine King, pressed on him
the duties of his station, and demanded whether
those duties were being rightly exercised. Out of
that great ideal of Kingship has grown the reverence
for the modern King, though he be of smaller stature,
and has not often fulfilled his duties well; for that
ideal has printed itself on the heart of mankind,
and the passionate love, the intense loyalty, that go
out to a King, who is in any sense worthy of Kingship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
show how the human heart loves to reverence and
to honour, where high power and great position are
in any way worthy of the privileges enjoyed.</p>

<p>And always one great warning went out to those
ancient Kings, as spoken by Bh&#299;&#7779;hma, the Master
of &#7692;harma, when the blameless King Yu&#7693;hi&#7779;hthira
went to him to ask as to the duties of the Elder
Brother of the Nation. He bade him remember
that behind the King was the Law, the Divine
Law, which none might break with impunity.
And then those famous words were spoken that
every King should daily remember: "Take care,
O King, of the weak, not of the strong; take care of
the weak, for the tears of the weak undermine the
throne of Kings." That is the great lesson for
modern rulers. You may have enemies, you can
fight them and conquer them; you may have difficulties,
you can surmount them and turn them into steps
upwards; but take care of the poor, take care of the
miserable, take care of the starving of your realm.
For of these, said Bh&#299;&#7779;hma, to whose cry no man
listens, the cry enters into the ears of God, who calls
on His representative to give account for the miseries
of the poor, and who avenges their wrongs by the
destruction of the careless King. Now there lies
the old ideal.</p>

<p>But many of the States of the past were built on the
denial of this great Law of Brotherhood. Look at Babylonia;
look at the later Egypt; look at the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Republics of Greece; look at the masses of the people
under the Roman Empire; what do you find? You find
that every great Empire of the later past has been built
on a foundation of the misery of the lowest of the
people. You find that the vast majority in these Empires
were slaves&mdash;slaves in name, as well as in reality.
Brotherhood was denied; the weak were trampled
on; strength was used to plunder and not to cherish;
with the result that every such Empire has faded
from the pages of history. When we want to know
their stories we have to burrow in their sepulchres,
for they built against the Law of Brotherhood, and
the Law has broken them into pieces, and they are
dead. Now of all the ancient Empires, Babylonia,
Assyria, Nineveh, Egypt, Greece, Rome, all these have
passed away; only one Nation remains of that splendid
circle of civilisations in the past; only one people,
contemporary with those mighty Empires, is still a
living Nation; they are dead, nay, they are buried,
and only the fragments of their bones remain; but
one of their contemporaries lives in our modern days,
for the India, that traded with Babylonia in the
might of her prosperity, is a living Nation in
the twentieth century. And why? because in her
teaching, because in her religion, because in her
literature, she taught the Law of Brotherhood, though
later she ceased to live it out in practice, and then
began her long downward course. The old theory of
the castes was a law of Brotherhood; the Sh&#363;&#7693;ra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
who serves, said Manu, he is to be the younger child
in your family. There is no humiliation in being a
younger child in a family; there is no shame in being
one of the juniors of the circle of brothers and
sisters; nay, it means the enjoyment of the tenderest
compassion; it means a gentle protective attitude;
it means that when anything is wanted, the younger
shall have what there is and the elder shall go without.
That was the old ideal of the Sh&#363;&#7693;ra, who was
to be the young and undeveloped soul. Let him in
the National household be the cherished youngling
of the family; let him be as your younger son.
Then came restrictions with the growing age of the
soul. The Vaishya&mdash;he was to accumulate wealth;
he was to enjoy; he was to be the centre of the great
family life, the parent, the supporter of the whole
National household. Certainly wealth was to be
acquired, but in order to be dispensed&mdash;wealth to
support the remaining Orders in the State. And that
charity that you still find in India, the charity which
is of the older days rather than of to-day, is still ingrained
in the whole Vaishya caste. For though they
will gather wealth&mdash;pie by pie, anna by anna, rupee
by rupee, they give it away in lakhs and crores for
the use of the people. All that is wanted in this
charity is to change the direction. There is no use
in letting fertilising water run over rocks, because
they were once fields; turn it into the fields of to-day,
which will then blossom as the rose. I say of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the charity of this great wealth-caste, the merchants,
the traders, of modern India, that they should turn
the wealth they give away so largely into the
fertilising streams which will nourish the National
fields. Their duty as brothers who are working for
the National household, is not only to build temples,
to gild the outside of those temples of &#7692;evas. What is
the use of a temple, if the worshippers are not there?
And if you let your youths grope through their
studies without knowledge of religion, of what avail
to build a temple which will be left empty by them
in their manhood? It is the young who need
training in religion and in morality, and such
education is stopped for lack of the Vaishya
liberality. Education is left in the hands of Government,
whereas it is the duty of the householders of
the Nation. Education under National control,
Education in which religion shall form an integral
part of the curriculum, that is what India is
demanding to-day, and what many are struggling to
gain. That Central Hin&#7693;&#363; College which we built
in Benares, which has now flowered into the great
Hin&#7693;&#363; University, in that you have an attempt,
partly frustrated, I admit, to have a University under
National control; down in the South, in the great
foundation of a merchant of Madras, Pachaiyappa,
there you have also the possibility of building
up out of a College, a University under National
control.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>And remember that in this matter, the Indian
States under their own Princes are showing the way
in which Education should be developed. H. H. the
Nizam, the Ruler of Hyderabad, was first of the
Indian Princes who gave the order that in every
State school in his realm religion should be taught.
The religion of Isl&#257;m to the Musalm&#257;ns, the Hin&#7693;&#363;
religion to the Hin&#7693;&#363;s. And he took our textbooks
from the Central Hin&#7693;&#363; College in order that his
Hin&#7693;&#363; subjects might be taught along liberal
orthodox lines; it was a Musalm&#257;n Minister of
Education who sent out the decree that through the
kingdom of Hyderabad every child should be trained
in his father's religion, and that religious education
should be a part of the duty of the State. And
then, H. H. the Maharaja of Mysore took up the
same line, and in the State Schools of Mysore,
religion is an integral part of education. So it
is in some of the R&#257;jput States; so it is in some
of the Kathiawar States; and these Indian Princes are
showing the way to a religious education, that shall
be National without being sectarian, that shall not
proselytise, that shall not turn boys away from their
ancestral faith, but shall respect the religion of the
parents, and bring up the children in the faith
into which they were born. But you see how
the realisation of this needs the charity of the
great Vaishya caste, in order that the money
may be available which shall make the schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
under National control the equals of the Government
establishments.</p>

<p>Then, in that caste system, you come to the
K&#7779;ha&#7789;&#7789;riya, from whom more was demanded than from
the Vaishya. He had the right to splendour; he had
the right to enjoy; he had the right to wealth; but
on one condition: he must be willing to sacrifice
everything, if the safety of the people demanded it.
From him was asked the offering of limb, the offering
of life. If he ruled, he must be first in the
battle as well as first in the pageant, and he
must learn to give up life, family, love, and all
that makes life joyous, if the people were in need
of protection, and if the order of the State were
threatened. And then came the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, the
teacher, the wise man, the educator of the people.
He was not to be wealthy save in wisdom; he was
not to gratify desires, but was to be the mouth of
God, pure in conduct, ascetic in life; he was to show
that the wise man needed not wealth, and that the
duty of wisdom was to teach the people. A splendid
theory, carried out for many ages. All is in confusion
now. The &#7693;harmas of the castes have broken into
pieces, and with the &#7693;harmas the reality has disappeared.
And so the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a the elder brother, is
a lawyer, a merchant, a physician, or anything else, an
engine driver sometimes, but seldom a teacher from
a sense of &#7693;harma. And with the old duty, the old
reverence has passed away; for only when the elders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
live up to their duties can the youngers be asked to
give them reverence. And so now, Indian Society has
to be rebuilt. It has lived, as I have said, because
the Law of Brotherhood was its centre, its theory,
though its practical denial brought on it the judgment
of decay. We find now in our India a mass of
conquered people, a slave population in everything
but name. The "untouchable" too often goes so foul
in body, so foul in speech, in food, that the cleanly
shrink from personal contact, and they are left
in their foulness, their degradation. But if it be
true that the tears of the weak undermine the
throne of Kings, what of the denial of Brotherhood
which has made this lowest population in our midst?
The sweeper, the scavenger, those who perform the
hardest duties in Society, they are trampled under
foot. India cannot live, if she persist in that denial
of Brotherhood, which leaves one section of her
population untouchable by the remaining cleanlier
people. They were conquered, they were trampled on,
they were made outcastes, every foul duty was made
their work; they were sacrificed to keep you clean;
they were untouchable that you might be refined;
they were left in ignorance that you might be educated;
and they were degraded that you might be raised.
Do you think that the cries of the miserable have
not entered into the ears of God? And He looked
upon India, and made a stern decree: As you enslave
your brethren, you shall yourselves be enslaved.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>What ought to be the attitude of Society towards the
man, the class, that makes possible cleanliness, refinement
and delicacy of life? If you had to clean out
your own foul places, if you had to sweep your yards
and your streets, would you be as delicate, as
refined, as you are to-day? But if these men and
women do these humble offices in order that you
may live in cleanliness, ought you not to repay them
with gratitude and not with contempt, with respect
and not with opprobrium? They make your lives
possible; your children will have to do these
things, your wife and your children, if the scavengers
are not there to do the work, and you treat
contemptuously those who make possible your
civilised life. There lies your crime as a Nation
against Brotherhood, and India need not expect to
stand high among the Nations of the world, until she
sets herself to this work of redeeming her own
outcaste population. You are not alone. Other
Nations are similar to you. In the country whence
my body comes one-tenth of the population is
degraded, like your one-sixth. One-tenth of the
London population die in the work-house, the prison,
the hospital. But I am bound to say to you,
though I am sorry to say it, that you remain asleep
while England is awake to her duty to her outcaste
population, and she is beginning to redeem them
from the degradation in which hitherto they have
lived. She is educating them, and where education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
is, there refinement inevitably follows. She is
beginning to realise that the lowest work ought to be
the shortest. That the lowest work has a right to
decent living. That if a man be sacrificed to social
necessities, he should be repaid by a leisure which
would enable him to live above the degrading tendencies
of the necessary surroundings of his work. The
British are building houses for them, they are educating
their children, they are helping them to live in
decency, and so, they are gaining the right to enjoy
the freedom they have won. And to you, my Indian
brethren, I would say, that if you hold up your hands
to &#298;shvara and pray that liberty may be your own,
those hands will never be filled with liberty until you
have poured out freedom among your own people, and
have begun to redeem your miserable slave population.
For Justice is the Divine Law. Those who oppress
shall be oppressed; those who trample shall be
trampled on; those who make others outcastes
shall be outcastes themselves. Until you obey the
law of Brotherhood in your dealings with these younger
brothers, ignorant, degraded, helpless, you will not
win the smile of the &#7692;eva of India, nor have His
mighty force running upon your side to redeem. But
you are waking up, you are beginning to realise your
duty. Schools must be scattered over the whole country
for the education of the submerged classes; every
such school is a temple of Brotherhood, and is quickening
the coming of the salvation of the Indian Nation.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>And now, finally, what is individual duty as regards
Brotherhood? First, to realise that the very condition
of the spiritual life is to see the same Self in all
equally dwelling. The Self dwells in the outcaste as
in the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, dwells in the most degraded as
in the purest and the noblest; and there is one law of
the spiritual life, that as you pour out to others, so
shall your own vessel be filled with the water of life.
Each of us, then, has a duty as a brother. We are
the elders of those younger brothers of our race, and
the Law of Brotherhood for the coming Society
is, as I said, that every man born into a civilised
community shall live under conditions that enable
him to develop to the utmost every faculty that
he brings with him into the world. That is
the law of the coming civilisation. Every child
born among you has a right to develop all that
he has within him. No obstacles should be placed
in his way. Facilities of development should
be given. Some are not your equals, but you must
not therefore stunt their growth. Every man has the
God-given right to develop all that he possesses within
him. You must put no artificial barriers. You must
make no difficulties which shall be insuperable to
them. You must help by virtue of your own longer
evolution. You must learn together, in order that
you may know the fulness of the Divine Life. But
there is this great difference between the life of
Matter and the life of Spirit. If on this table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
I had a heap of golden coins, and if I said I would
give them to you, what a rush there would be for
them. But why the rush? Because you know that
with every gold mohur given away, there is one less
to give away to those who are behind; and so every
one wants to be in front, for suppose there is not
enough to go round? Sometimes men might try to
grasp two or three, so that they may have for
the future as well as for the day. It is the
law of matter that it perishes in the using; hence
there is always struggle; hence it generates divisions,
it is the parent of quarrels. But if you knew that
there was enough for all, there would be no struggle;
if you knew the last would be as the first, there would
be no fighting. The law of the Spirit is quite other,
for the Spirit lives by giving, not by taking. The
Spirit increases by using, he does not waste. As the
Spirit has three great aspects of Will, of Consciousness,
of Intellect, these are the priceless possessions that
we have, and that we can give away without fear of
wasting. I have a truth that you have not, and go
out and proclaim the truth among you; am I the
poorer because you know the truth, or do I know the
truth all the better, because in giving it I have
appropriated it more thoroughly than I did before?
There is no wastage, there is no diminishing; my
truth is mine; and when I have given it to every one
of you, and you all possess that truth, mine is no
lesser. Truth never wastes in the sharing. As you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
can light one candle from another, and the flame
never diminishes though you light a thousand from
it, so it is in the case of truth. Knowledge lights
new knowledge, so that the total illumination
grows greater and not less. Hence if you have
knowledge, do not give it among those who already
share it, but go out to the ignorant and give it to
them. If you are wise, your duty is to make others
wise, and not to sit in your own study and enjoy the
wisdom as though it were a miser's treasure to gloat
over. Knowledge that is not shared becomes a
cancer in the brain, and the power to know diminishes
and is finally lost, when you refuse to share with
your ignorant brother that which you acquired from
the boundless stores of Nature. And Purity? Are you
pure, in order that you may wrap your garments
round you and say to the impure: Stand aside. I
will not be polluted. O my friends, the purity that
can be polluted is not purity at all, but a garment
cast over impurity, hiding it from the world. Purity
cannot be soiled; purity cannot be stained; and
the duty of the pure is to go out among the
impure, in order that they may be purified and
lifted to the higher standard. Some I know, would
say: "Level down. Pull the educated down. Pull
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a down. Pull the rich man down.
Let us have equality." Equality of what?
Of ignorance, of misery, of poverty, of general
wretchedness? Nay; lift up the poor to the level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of the rich, and let all be comfortable, and none have
superfluities. Lift up the ignorant by learning, and
so let all be happy in the enjoyment of the treasures
of the mind. Go among the sinners, the foul, and the
debased, and raise them up to your own purity, and
so let the whole nation be pure and educated and
healthy and well-fed. And of this be sure&mdash;it is
written in a Christian Scripture, and is written hundreds
of times in your own&mdash;"God has made of one blood
all the Nations of the earth." Is there one man among
you who has not the right to lift up his eyes and say
to Brahman: "I am Thou"? Is there one man to
whom we can deny the glory of the indwelling
Divinity of Spirit? If that be so, and you know it is
so, then as your body may have all the life-blood
poisoned if a snake sheds his venom into the lowest
part of the body; if that poison circles in the blood
through all your body, your head and your limbs
begin to be paralysed, and your whole body suffers;
presently your body will die, though the wound was
only in the foot. So it is with the Nation. If the
poison is in the foot, in the lowest part of the National
body, it spreads through the whole of the Nation, and
no part of it is strong. If one man be poor, no rich
man is perfectly happy in the enjoyment of his
wealth. If one man be ignorant, no wise man can rise
to the highest of his mental faculties. If one
man be diseased, the health of the whole Nation is
lowered. Oh! Nature is always teaching it to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Plague begins in a filthy quarter of the town, but
it spreads to a palace. In London, in the miserable
dwelling of the seamstress, when she makes a ball-dress
for a Court Ball, she at times stitches into
it her fever, which is the outcome of starvation;
and the ball-dress carries it down to the house of a
noble, and so it catches the fair daughter of the
family. She catches typhoid, and she perishes of
the fever generated in the London slum. You cannot
separate yourselves; you are brothers whether you
will or not. You change your bodies; not one of
you will go out of this hall with exactly the
same body as you had when you entered it; some
particles of your neighbour's body have come into
yours. Some of yours have come to me. If you are
diseased, you infect others; if you are healthy,
your health infects others; if you are drunken, you
communicate the poison of drink; if you are
plague-stricken, the plague germs run from you
to the healthy man. God has so bound us together
that we cannot break the chain. Bound as brothers
in suffering we must be, if we will not be brothers
in love, in health, and in compassion. And so,
to you, my brothers, I say: Take heed to yourselves;
you stand with the greatest opportunity opening
before you, mighty possibilities lie in the near
future, which are yours if your hands are pure
and your hearts are clean. No Nation has lived,
where its poor were despised. The fragments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
past warn you of the dangers of your present. Live
the Law of Brotherhood; rescue the miserable; teach
the ignorant; feed the starving; nurse the diseased;
and, on our India, on her future, the &#7692;eva of India
shall pour out His blessing, when she lives the law
that she has always recognised in theory. That
Future shall be mightier than her Past has been, a
resurrection of the Spirit, and the spiritualisation of
the flesh.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
